7:30 p.m.<br></strong><p>One of the great joys of Christmas is the music … one of the great joys of this Christmas is the opportunity to experience that music through the genius of Quartette! Whether it’s traditional favourites like “Silent Night” and “What Child Is This?” or Quartette originals such as “The Perfect Christmas Tree” and “Hope, Peace, Joy and Love”, Canadian singer/songwriters Cindy Church, Caitlin Hanford, Gwen Swick and Sylvia Tyson enchant with their singularly lush harmonies, unique arrangements and rich variety of musical influences.<br><br>The genesis of Quartette was happenstance … a “songwriter in the round” showcase of Canadian women songwriters hosted by Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre in 1993. What began as a concert of musical friends grew into an inspired collaboration, generating public and critical acclaim, and catching the ear of Peter Gzowski, who invited them to perform on his CBC Radio show Morningside. Later Gzowski would say of that performance: “The CBC switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree with people looking for a recording!” Seven months later they released their self-titled album. Since then, Quartette has released five more recordings – two of them Christmas collections, garnered multiple Juno nominations, won the Canadian Country Music Award for best vocal collaboration, performed with major symphonies across Canada, been repeat guests on Garrison Keillor’s A Prairie Home Companion, recorded a CMT-TV Christmas special and of course continued to tour the country, either in support of their most recent release or for their ever-popular Christmas performances.<br><br>Laughter, refreshing arrangements of old and new, impeccable harmonies, tales of love and inspiration, four lovely ladies celebrating 23 years of musical friendship … “A Quartette Christmas.” <br><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Music, Holiday<br><strong>Language:

<br><p><br>A B.C. boy from a family of railway workers makes it to the semifinals of America’s Got Talent only to make a 24-foot steel steam train locomotive disappear live on television. The act still baffles the world as Murray takes his place at the helm of a new generation of tech-savvy magicians. Hot on the heels of the sell-out success of Darcy Oake, we welcome another home-grown illusionist full of fantastic tricks and loads of laughs along the way. <p> <p>Murray made waves on the small screen, impressing judges with his incredible feats and slick showmanship. Keeping him on the cutting edge of entertainment, he now performs out of Vegas, where audiences can’t get enough of his signature slapstick act alongside impeccable illusions. Murray uses physical comedy so skillfully, you won’t know what you like best: the absurd or the incredible. With a clown-like mop of spiky white hair and a charming-but-mischievous smile, it’s easy to forget that Murray won dozens of awards and was crowned a world champion in the magic community even before he set out to dominate reality television, Las Vegas, and multiple world tours. Bringing all that talent back to his home and native land, Murray will make you chuckle, then leave you awe-struck in this captivating hour-long show. <p><br><a href=\"http://ev7.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ACP%3AC1617%3ACT0210T%3A&linkID=centrepointe&shopperContext=&pc=&caller=&appCode=&groupCode=VCPT&cgc=\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> <a href=\"http://ev7.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetPackageInfo?packageCode=GS%3ACP%3A%3A16FLX4%3A&linkID=centrepointe&shopperContext=&caller=&appCode=\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> <a href=\"http://ev7.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/EVExecMacro?linkID=centrepointe&evm=myac&msgCode=32000&shopperContext=ST&returnURL=/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetGroupList%3FlinkID%3Dcentrepointe%26groupCode%3D%26RSRC%3D%26RDAT%3D%26shopperContext%3DST&url=/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetGroupList%3FlinkID%3Dcentrepointe%26groupCode%3D%26RSRC%3D%26RDAT%3D%26shopperContext%3DST\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><a href=\"http://murraymagic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>   <a href=\"http://facebook.com/MurrayFanPage\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>   <a href=\"http://twitter.com/murraysawchuck\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9IglFzRsmPkVb1G8qifuA/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><br> <strong>Looking for a deal?

This month we are featuring local artist, Claire Sarfeld. \n \nEach painting of Sarfeld’s functions as a fresh page in her artistic journal, she uses the canvas to fuel her daily curiosity in one-way or another. Seeing each canvas as a new piece of work is a large part of her practice. To forget and start fresh, and to learn from each painting as she creates, usually working on one or two simultaneously. \n \nStop by to relax after a busy week at work and get to know other creative and active members of your local community.

Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating &quot;SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error&quot;, or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? We will walk through two corrupt databases, exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly, we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time. Speaker: Steve Stedman is the leader of the Bellingham PASS Chapter in WA, USA.

Mayhem&#39;s career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (&quot;Dead&quot;) and 1993 murder of guitarist ystein Aarseth (&quot;Euronymous&quot;) by former member Varg Vikernes (&quot;Count Grishnackh&quot;), also of Burzum.The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth&#39;s murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (&quot;Hellhammer&quot;), Jrn Stubberud (&quot;Necrobutcher&quot;) and Sven Erik Kristiansen (&quot;Maniac&quot;) reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (&quot;Blasphemer&quot;) replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar since replaced Kristiansen.The band&#39;s music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the wider metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. Mayhem&#39;s most recent album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for Best Metal Album in 2007.","modified":"2016-10-25 18:35:38","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"rain_uk","linker":"evdb","name":"THE MAYHEM","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/THE-MAYHEM?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000091854-0","short_bio":"NO TURNING BACK!"}},"price":"$30.00","title":"Mayhem","venue_address":"10030 102 Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates","id":"music"},{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates: Dance","id":"music_dance"},{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates: Alternative","id":"music_alternative"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/677/911-0.jpeg_/the-mayhem-11.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/677/911-0.jpeg_/the-mayhem-11.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/677/911-0.jpeg_/the-mayhem-11.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/677/911-0.jpeg_/the-mayhem-11.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-10-25 18:35:38","venue_id":"V0-001-000548011-2","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Starlite Room","venue_url":"http://edmonton.eventful.com/venues/the-starlite-room-/V0-001-000548011-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Edmonton","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"AB","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"53.5271580","groups":null,"url":"http://edmonton.eventful.com/events/celtic-tenors-/E0-001-095256421-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095256421-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Sherwood Park","link_count":null,"longitude":"-113.3029545","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Alberta","start_time":"2016-12-02 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-07-27 08:36:33","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"evdb","linker":"evdb","name":"The Celtic Tenors","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/The-Celtic-Tenors?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000384264-6","short_bio":"Classical / Vocal / World"}},"price":null,"title":"Celtic Tenors","venue_address":"100 Festival Way","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates","id":"music"},{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates: Classical","id":"music_classical"},{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates: Vocal","id":"music_vocal"},{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates: World","id":"music_world"},{"name":"Holiday","id":"holiday"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/473/163-5.jpeg_/the-celtic-tenors-63.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/473/163-5.jpeg_/the-celtic-tenors-63.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/473/163-5.jpeg_/the-celtic-tenors-63.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/473/163-5.jpeg_/the-celtic-tenors-63.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-27 08:36:33","venue_id":"V0-001-001276670-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Festival Place","venue_url":"http://edmonton.eventful.com/venues/festival-place-/V0-001-001276670-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Toronto","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"ON","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"43.6684293","groups":null,"url":"http://toronto.eventful.com/events/romkids-day-camp-/E0-001-096947594-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096947594-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Toronto","link_count":null,"longitude":"-79.3947709","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Ontario","start_time":"2016-12-02 08:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Looking for something to do with the kids on their school PD Days?\nJoin us at the ROM for a day at camp!\n\nKids have special access to hands-on learning at the Museum.

On the strength of their simple yet insightful songwriting and distinctive harmonies, they quietly sold more than a million records, with over 17 million streams on Spotify, and 20 million views on YouTube. They married and had three children, rarely touring but continuing to release their music, five records over seven years.Just before Christmas 2013, when their youngest son was 17 months old, Deb Talan was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. She was in chemo by New Year&#39;s Eve.In 2014, Deb beat cancer, and The Weepies recorded the best album of their career. Coming back from the edge sharpened their skills and focus. At 16 songs and almost an hour long, SIRENS shows a band at the height of its powers.The couple was unable to travel while Deb was in treatment, so they worked at home, inviting guest musicians to record remotely wherever each musician happened to be, resulting in an unlikely superstar backing band. Players from across the spectrum jumped in, including: Pete Thomas and Steve Nieve (Elvis Costello), Gerry Leonard (David Bowie), Rami Jaffee (Foo Fighters), Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel), Oliver Kraus (Sia) and Matt Chamberlain (Pearl Jam), as well as veteran Weepies compatriots Frank Lenz, Eli Thomson, Jon Flaugher, Meg Toohey, and Whynot Jansveld, plus a horn section from New Orleans.The prophetic &quot;No Trouble&quot; was written prior to learning Deb&#39;s diagnosis. &quot;I don&#39;t need no trouble, but sometimes trouble needs me,&quot; sings Steve; Deb&#39;s vocals were recorded during her first weeks of chemo. The couple continued to write and record throughout treatment, with Deb providing several key vocals far into the year, including title track &quot;Sirens,&quot; captured in one take on a day where Deb really only had one take in her; her vulnerability is tangible. &quot;We just kept going,&quot; says Deb. &quot;We also have 3 small children, and were homeschooling, and the effects of chemo blew whole days out of the water.&quot;The band was able to use their limited studio time as an escape, leading to some of their most joyful tracks ever, including the genre-bending &quot;Fancy Things&quot; and the upbeat &quot;Early Morning Riser,&quot; aided mightily by a fantastic rhythm section and horns. There&#39;s plenty of heart and comfort for long time Weepies fans too the deceptively simple &quot;My Little Love,&quot; the gorgeous &quot;Brand New Pair of Wings&quot; and the straight ahead poetry of &quot;River From the Sky.&quot;After The Weepies had officially finished the album, and Deb was in recovery, they continued to record remotely with their phenomenal backing musicians for fun, eventuallyadding a cover of Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and a version of Irish balladeer Mark Geary&#39;s &quot;Volunteer&quot; to the final album.&quot;No one song could capture that year,&quot; says Steve. &quot;16 seems like a lot to release at once, but each song reflects a different angle of that long, suspended moment. They hang together like a bunch of photographs from a certain time. It was intense, but there was beauty and inspiration, too. Deb made it back. And we&#39;re still here.&quot;SIRENS will be released by Nettwerk worldwide on April 28, 2015.","modified":"2016-09-21 10:58:26","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"nettwerkmusic","linker":"evdb","name":"The Weepies","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/The-Weepies?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000007745-4","short_bio":"Pop / Rock / Acoustic"}},"price":"$18.50","title":"The Weepies","venue_address":"1150 Queen Street West","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Concerts &amp;

However, Rodgers left early in their development to form another local punk attraction, the Adolescents. His replacement was James Levesque.The band&#39;s first important supporter was KROQ disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, who was fundamental to the promotion of many similar outfits. Their debut release, the Bloodstains EP, was the only one to feature Rodgers, and its title track was the first song the fledgling band wrote. Afterwards, they signed to prominent local label Posh Boy Records, run by Robbie Fields. The subsequent debut album showed the band rising above the usual three-chord bluster of hardcore with a melodic approach that recalled 60s surf instrumental bands (the Ventures being the most obvious influence). However, the band stormed out of the studio near to the album&#39;s completion, complaining about being &quot;produced&#39; and Fields&#39; behaviour in general, leaving engineer David Hines and Jay Lansford (of Simpletones, Stepmothers and Channel 3 fame) to finish off the recordings. The Bitchin&#39; Summer EP was one of the first skate/surf punk crossover items, with three energized surf guitar instrumentals establishing the band&#39;s future direction. Various problems delayed the next release until the trio signed with Enigma Records for 1984&quot;s When You Least Expect It ... EP, which saw a conscious and largely unsuccessful attempt to accommodate a more disciplined, polished sound, a mistake compounded by a pointless cover version of Jefferson Airplane&#39;s &quot;Somebody To Love&#39;. However, all the elements came together for 1986&quot;s This Is The Voice - the overdriven guitar mesh now allied to first-rate songwriting and delivery. This time the cover of &quot;Dangerman&quot; was fine, but subordinate to the Agent Orange originals. Levesque had been replaced by Brent Liles (ex-Social Distortion) the previous year.Agent Orange remained largely quiet during the early part of the 90s save for a live album. Palm returned in 1996 with two new members and a studio album, Virtually Indestructible. Their 2000 release was a mixture of new recordings and re-recordings.","modified":"2016-08-28 01:51:24","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":"$15.00","title":"Agent Orange","venue_address":"917 Main Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp; Miscellaneous","id":"other"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/019/456/470-7.jpeg_/agent-orange-70.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/019/456/470-7.jpeg_/agent-orange-70.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/019/456/470-7.jpeg_/agent-orange-70.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/019/456/470-7.jpeg_/agent-orange-70.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-28 01:51:24","venue_id":"V0-001-000299409-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Cobalt","venue_url":"http://vancouver.eventful.com/venues/the-cobalt-/V0-001-000299409-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Vancouver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"BC","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"49.2505","groups":null,"url":"http://vancouver.eventful.com/events/posies-secret-pop-up-show-vancouver-/E0-001-095739711-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095739711-5","privacy":"1","city_name":"Vancouver","link_count":null,"longitude":"-123.112","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"British Columbia","start_time":"2016-11-15 18:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" The Posies are back with round two of their SECRET POP UP SHOW tour.

The film is a parody of B-movie, science fiction and horror films of the late 1940s through early 1970s. Director Jim Sharman collaborated on the screenplay with O&#39;Brien, who wrote both the book and lyrics for the stage. The film introduces Tim Curry and features Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick along with cast members from the original Kings Road production presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in 1973.Still in limited release nearly 37 years after its premiere, it has the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It gained notoriety as a midnight movie in 1977 when audiences began participating with the film in theatres. Rocky Horror is the first film from a major Hollywood studio to be in the midnight movie market. The motion picture has a large international cult following and is one of the most well known and financially successful midnight movies of all time. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.","modified":"2016-10-25 18:37:43","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"devol4","linker":"evdb","name":"Rocky Horror Picture Show","url":"http://eventful.com/performers/rocky-horror-picture-show-/P0-001-000049180-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000049180-3","short_bio":"The Rocky Horror Picture Show Musical"}},"price":"$10.00","title":"The Rocky Horror Picture Show","venue_address":"698 Osborne Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Film","id":"movies_film"},{"name":"Performing Arts","id":"performing_arts"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/343/267-6.jpeg_/rocky-horror-picture-show-67.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/343/267-6.jpeg_/rocky-horror-picture-show-67.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/343/267-6.jpeg_/rocky-horror-picture-show-67.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/343/267-6.jpeg_/rocky-horror-picture-show-67.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-10-25 18:37:43","venue_id":"V0-001-002128947-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Park Theatre","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/winnipeg/venues/the-park-theatre-/V0-001-002128947-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"}]}}
