Edward Island","start_time":"2016-11-10 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Do you love to sing (even though you might not consider yourself “a singer” or only feel comfortable singing alone in the car)? Singing in a group has significant benefits whether you’re on key or not – science says it’s like “an infusion of the perfect tranquilizer, the kind that both soothes your nerves and elevates your spirits.” PLAYING WITH CHOIR is an opportunity to come together in a large group to learn simple 2 or 3 part harmonies for popular songs of today and past decades and belt them out for the simple joy of singing. No auditions, no solos, no stars, just fun. Fall 2016 Term The Fall 2016 term schedule will begin Monday, October 24 and conclude Monday, December 12. The sessions will be from 7:00 – 9:00. There will be no session on Monday, October 31 (so we can all go trick or treating). In this first term, we’ll be learning original arrangements for: Lean On Me (Bill Withers) One Fine Day (The Chiffons) Tell Him (The Exciters) Every Breath You Take (Police) Have You Ever Seen The Rain (CCR) Peaceful Easy Feeling (Eagles) Killing Me Softly (Fugees) Hey Ho (Lumineers) With Or Without You (U2)   FAQs What’s the fee? The registration fee for this initial 7-week term is $70, which covers the costs involved in creating original arrangements of the awesome songs we’ll sing, a Choir Director to teach us our parts and lead our singing, an accompanist, space, promotion, administration, communication/coordination, and printing.   How often are sessions? Each year, we aim to have Fall, Winter and Spring terms consisting of 7-10 weekly 2-hour sessions.   Who can join? If you are an adult 19+ who loves to sing and plays well with others, we’d be thrilled to welcome you to the gang. No singing experience is necessary, and you will not be required to read music. Our focus is on fun and comfort – there are no auditions and you will never have to sing alone.   What if I can&#39;t make a session? We’ll miss you. But we won’t be mad.   Does the choir perform? There are currently no plans for performance, however, there may be opportunities arise as we progress. When those opportunities do come up, they will be completely optional. Our focus truly is on coming together to sing and have fun.   What should I expect at a session? The Choir Director (the amazing Jill Chandler) will begin each session with some physical and vocal warm ups. She will focus each session on teaching one or two new songs, breaking the group into two or three sections, each learning their part of the song’s harmony. By the end of the night we’ll bring it all together in a gorgeous full-choir rendition that we’ll video so you can boast to your friends and family about how awesome you sound. While we will be expected to listen to the Choir Director, and do as she instructs, the setting will be casual and fun.  While we expect that most of the songs we’ll learn will be songs you know and love, we will give you a heads up regarding the line-up in case you want to familiarize yourself with a song before the evening begins. New songs will be added throughout the term and by the end, we’ll have a repertoire of great songs and feel like stars.   Who chooses the songs and do choir members get a say? Songs are chosen before each term begins by the admin team and we are happy to have suggestions for following terms.   Do I have to audition or sing alone? No! We’re all about fun and comfort. Skill levels and experience will vary and that’s totally cool. There will be no solos or auditions. It’s all about one voice.   What if I really can’t sing? Don’t worry! There will be so many voices, it will all come together.   Do I need to know how to read music? Nope! We’ll hand out a lyric sheet and you’ll learn the notes by listening to the director and through repetition.   Do I need singing experience? If your only singing experience is alone in the car, that’s cool with us. As long as you love to sing, you’re in.   Can I pay as I go? Sorry, in order for us to feel confident we’ll be able to cover our expenses, we require registration and payment in advance of the term.   Who are you awesome people and how did this start? Emma Fugate loves to sing, but had no outlet to do so in a group. She heard about the world-wide trend of pop choirs and lobbed the idea at a ton of people over the past two years until it stuck to one of them. She and Kirstin Lund spent the better part of a drive home from a conference in Boston scheming about how to create one in PEI.

The Story: In Detroit, suburbanites Ben (Joel Wirkunnen) and Mary (Jennifer Copping) fire up the backyard grill to welcome the new neighbours, recovering addicts Sharon (Luisa Jojick) and Kenny (Aaron Craven), who have moved into the long-empty house next door. The fledgling friendship soon veers out of control, shattering the fragile hold that newly unemployed Ben and burgeoning alcoholic Mary have on their way of lifewith unexpected comic consequences. We present this timely show while Vancouvers housing crisis is a hot topic and our city continues to struggle with the plight of the homeless and addicted. Detroit tackles these issues with humour and deep humanity. This play was a 2011 Pulitzer prize finalist and is a timely addition to the evolving presence of our company in the city&#39;s theatre ecology. We are so excited to bring this play to Vancouver at such a delicate and tenuous time in the city&#39;s history. With 12 Jessie nominations to its name, Mitch and Murray Productions is a theatre company that lives on the edge, with a focus on contemporary, character-driven storytelling that rocks the status quo and provokes laughter, cringing and lively debate.

Known for their electrifying live performances the band has toured nationally and abroad, playing a moody but uplifting americana with an extensive instrumental arsenal (accordion, cello, mandolin, theremin). For the uninitiated, the band’s all-over-the-map melodic avant-folk is equal parts Washington Irving and Woodstock, tapping a broad palette of styles ranging from dusty Americana ballads to huge Pink Floydesque cinematic anthems.  “The entire root system of Rock Family Trees is embedded in Longo’s voice.”- The Big Issue, Scotland, U.K. The Slambovian Circus of Dreams have been called  “the hillbilly Pink Floyd,” which is an apt description, particularly if you throw in elements of Incredible String Band, Neil Young, The Band, Dylan, Bowie and Syd Barrett.<br><br>The band runs its own label, with 4 critically acclaimed studio albums  <a href=\"http://store.slambovia.com/The_Grand_Slambovians_The_New_Album_p/music-cd-grandslam.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">“The Grand Slambovians”</a>2010, <a href=\"http://store.slambovia.com/The_Great_Unravel_CD_p/music-cd-greatunravel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘The Great Unravel’</a> (2008), 2004’s double-disc <a href=\"http://store.slambovia.com/Flapjacks_from_the_Sky_CD_p/music-cd-flapjacks.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘Flapjacks from the Sky’</a>, and <a href=\"http://store.slambovia.com/A_Good_Thief_Tips_His_Hat_CD_p/music-cd-goodthief.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘A Good Thief Tips His Hat</a>‘ (1998) in its catalogue. In 2014, ‘A Box of Everything’, was licensed to Red River/Sony Red as the band’s ‘greatest hits you’ve never heard’. The bands next studio album, ‘A Very Unusual Head’ is scheduled for release summer/fall 2016, unleashing their hauntingly signature songs on the world once again. Guests on the album will include friends and fellow New Yorkers including guitarist Gary Lucas, Willie Nile, <em>and many more</em>.  <br><p> <p><b>The Slambovian Circus of Dreams are:</b><p><b><a href=\"http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/JOE-XMASTC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></b><p><b>Joziah Longo</b> (lead vocals, guitars, harmonica), born in Philadelphia, grew up playing traditional country, folk and mummers music with his father. Performing professionally from the age of 13 doing Dylan covers, he moved to New York to pursue his muse. Playing venues ranging from CBGB’s to Carnegie Hall as a headline performer, Joziah was also the first American songwriter invited to perform in mainland China in the early 90’s, signaling the end of a decade-long ban on Western music. Since 2010 Longo has worked with Broadway’s Circle in The Square Theater in New York City. Joziah wrote the music for 2 original productions, directed by the legendary Theodore Mann and is currently working on another project with new theater director, Jonathan Mann.<p><a href=\"http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TINK-WNTI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a>Multi-instrumentalist <b>Tink Lloyd</b> (accordion, cello, flute, theremin) comes from a long line of feisty Irish musicians which brings a spark to the band’s music as well as performance. Tink has worked with Joziah since meeting in the 1980’s.<p><b><a href=\"http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SHARKEY-WNTI3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></b><p><b>Sharkey McEwen</b> (guitars, mandolin, backing vocals), longtime musical partner of Joziah, has Louisiana roots but grew up in L.A. where he cut his teeth on the club circuit before coming to New York in the early 90’s. His inventive, evocative playing is a strong counterpoint to Joziah’s songwriting. He is has been the band’s main engineer and co-producer with Joziah since their first album.<p><p>A New York area native, <strong>Felipe Torres</strong> (drums, percussion, backing vocal) has been a musician and teacher for nearly 20 years. Having toured extensively throughout the USA, Canada and Europe, performing in a multitude of musical genres, Felipe brings a variety of drumming and color to the Slambovian world. His approach is directed and inspired by the mood and lyrical imagery conjured by the newly found musical kinship in Joziah and the band’s work.

doors <br><br><p>The Aeolian presents Great Lake Swimmers and Elliott Brood<p><strong>Dec 1st show ELLIOTT BROOD is Headlining</strong><p><strong>Ticket sales open Monday, September 12!</strong><p><p>A Forest Of Arms is the sixth album from Tony Dekker&#39;s Great Lake Swimmers and the follow up to 2012&#39;s New Wild Everywhere. With a surging rhythm section, razor sharp violin, and flourishing banjo and guitars, Dekker and band mates have pushed their sound significantly, creating some of their most dynamic songs ever recorded.<p>Those familiar with the decade-long output of Great Lake Swimmers will recognize the thematic threads of beauty in the natural world, environmental issues and explorations of close personal ties that hold us together. The familiar versus the strange theme is also running through this record, both in the instrumentation and in the songwriting (&quot;Zero In The City&quot;, &quot;I Was A Wayward Pastel Bay&quot;).<p>As with past Great Lake Swimmers albums, A Forest Of Arms was recorded in several locations over the span of several months, covering extensive new territory while remaining true to the group&#39;s refined sound. One of the unique and unusual locations was Tyendinaga Cavern and Caves in Tyendinaga, Ontario, where a number of the vocal and acoustic guitar tracks, including the main parts for &quot;Don&#39;t Leave Me Hanging,&quot; &quot;The Great Bear&quot; and &quot;With Every Departure,&quot; were recorded amid haunting acoustics, stalactites, and circling bats.<p>Great Lake Swimmers consists of Tony Dekker on lead vocals and guitar, long time guitarist and banjo player Erik Arnesen, Miranda Mulholland on violin and backing vocals, Bret Higgins on upright bass and newcomer Joshua Van Tassel on drums. There are several special guest appearances on the album by Kevin Kane (Grapes Of Wrath) on 12-string electric guitar, as well as backing vocals on the song &quot;A Bird Flew Inside The House.&quot;<p><p> <p><p>For their fifth album, Elliott Brood wanted to break things. 2008&#39;s Mountain Meadows was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize, and the band&#39;s last record, Days Into Years, won a 2011 Juno award for roots album of the year. Now was the time to smash the precedents, break the mould. To withdraw to a farmhouse in Bath, Ontario, hammering out nine songs in two weeks.<p>For the first time, Elliott Brood decided to work with an outside producer: Ian Blurton, who has helped make roaring records for the Weakerthans, Skydiggers and Cursed. And for the first time, the group&#39;s two songwriters decided to mine the bare histories of their own lives: penning verses about the ends of relationships and the tests of adulthood, long drives, childhood retreating in a rear-view mirror. &quot;Work and Love will make a man out of you,&quot; the Constantines sang; and so here is Elliott Brood&#39;s Work and Love, their most personal album to date, the sound of a grown-up band searching their hearts for all they&#39;ve lost and gained.<p> <p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-09-10 03:11:02","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":null,"title":"Great Lake Swimmers and Elliott Brood","venue_address":"795 Dundas Street East","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp; Miscellaneous","id":"other"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/744/672-2.jpeg_/great-lake-swimmers-and-elliott-brood-72.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/032/744/672-2.jpeg_/great-lake-swimmers-and-elliott-brood-72.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/744/672-2.jpeg_/great-lake-swimmers-and-elliott-brood-72.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/032/744/672-2.jpeg_/great-lake-swimmers-and-elliott-brood-72.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-09-10 03:11:02","venue_id":"V0-001-000369314-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Aeolian Hall","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/venues/aeolian-hall-/V0-001-000369314-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Montreal","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"QC","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"46.3560262","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/events/quebec-international-book-fair-/E0-001-090738534-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-090738534-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Trois-Rivières","link_count":null,"longitude":"-72.5854366","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Quebec","start_time":"2017-04-12 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Quebec international Book Fair is happening on 12 Apr 2017 at Quebec City Convention Centre Qu\\u00e9bec City, Canada.

After millions of albums sold, countless hit songs, and record breaking tours around the world, Séan realized that his 20 years with the band had to stop. Music is meant to connect, heal, and bring happiness. While Séan was giving that to thousands of people a night he was slowly losing his own way. Instead of seeking truth he was hiding behind his music. This was unfair to both himself and his fans so he left the band and started over.<p>In January 2014 Séan released his first post-GBS album. Produced by Joel Plaskett, “Help Your Self” is the sound of a man facing his demons and ultimately overcoming them. The songs helped him deal with his issues of addiction and abuse and showed him how to find strength in pain. It reminded him of the power of music which at one time would have been used to cast a Friday night spell over a sold out hockey arena on a Monday, but now finds him touring the country as a solo artist in intimate venues where he can sincerely connect with his audience in the way he always hoped to—face to face. Séan has also found himself using music as therapy, working with people who face physical, mental, and addiction challenges, and has become a sought after speaker trying to help others to help themselves find light through the darkness.<p>Séan’s journey to find his own peace, love, and happiness continues through his new music. “You Know I Love You” is a happy collection of songs sung by a man intent on sharing his joy directly with you. The world has changed. Today the only thing left between Séan’s music and those who wish to share it is a cellphone. Despite how small social media has made the world, and how it has included all of us into the same conversation with a simple hashtag #, the basic human quest for a connection to something real is too difficult to fit in just 140 characters.

This will also be the focus for the ADBA National Conference 2016, held at One Great George Street in the heart of Westminster. The conference is an opportunity for the industry to meet and discuss the drivers for change with politicians, policy makers and business leaders.  And it’s your chance to find out how the UK’s changing relationship with the world and the priorities of a new government will affect your business. The AD industry is changing too. With almost 100 waste plants, and over 200 farm plants, the UK has a strong base – the conference is a chance for operators, developers and their suppliers to discuss changes to the RHI mechanisms, farming and waste policy and developments in the water sector. It’s also where you can hear about new research and innovation proposals which aim to put the UK at the heart of the global AD industry and expand the potential of the industry around the world. Despite constrained electricity incentives, the conference will look at where the next set of AD developments will come from. What will the government’s response to the RHI consultation mean in practice? Will a revised RTFO finally get HGVs and buses running on biomethane?  Can farming policy make up for the degressing Feed-in Tariff? Will food waste collections finally become the norm in England? What will the water companies be investing in, and will sludge market deregulation offer opportunities to the wider market? We look forward to seeing you there. adbioresources.org  ","modified":"2016-09-05 06:44:36","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":null,"title":"ADBA National Conference 2016","venue_address":"Westminister London SW1P 3AA","geocode_type":"City Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp; Miscellaneous","id":"other"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/522/991-8.jpeg_/adba-national-conference-2016-91.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/032/522/991-8.jpeg_/adba-national-conference-2016-91.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/522/991-8.jpeg_/adba-national-conference-2016-91.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/032/522/991-8.jpeg_/adba-national-conference-2016-91.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-09-05 06:44:36","venue_id":"V0-001-001148101-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"One Great George Street","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/venues/one-great-george-street-/V0-001-001148101-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Toronto","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"ON","postal_code":"L2R 3C3","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"43.1596637","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/stcatharines/events/libertas-male-choir-knox-presbyterian-church-s-/E0-001-096273121-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096273121-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Saint Catharines","link_count":null,"longitude":"-79.2476280","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Ontario","start_time":"2016-12-01 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Libertas Male Choir invites the audience to participate in singing many related Advent/Christmas songs.
