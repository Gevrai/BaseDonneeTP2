Her new album More Love and Happiness is a vibrant blend of folk, jazz, and African influences that creates the perfect vehicle for Clelas intimate and dynamic vocal delivery.A classic late bloomer, Clela produced her first of four independent albums at the age of 43. As an artist, she is inspired by the beauty and power of the natural world, particularly the geography of her childhood home in the Thousand Islands region of the St Lawrence River.Before settling down in Toronto, Clela spent five years living on Canadas east coast, performing in P.E.I., New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Clela`s harmonica composition Lace Curtains was awarded Best Instrumental honourable mention in the Ontario Council of Folk Festivals Songs from The Heart.Throughout 2011, Clela performed in a duo with drummer John Adames (Prairie Oyster, BeBop Cowboys, Brothers Cosmoline). In 2012, Clela began singing with the womens choir, Essentia Vocal Ensemble. Their collective of singers and instrumentalists includes many of the bright lights on the music scene in Ontario. ~ www.essentiamusic.comIn 2014, Clela released a new album of original songs, More Love and Happiness, produced by Juno award winner Alec Fraser, bass player and producer for the late Jeff Healey. More Love and Happiness features multi-instrumentalist Chris Bartos and vocalist Jocelyn Barth.Currently Clela performs in an effervescent duo with her daughter Jocelyn Barth, offering up songs that highlight their shared artistry, impressive vocal range, and stunning improvisational skills.","modified":"2016-10-20 22:37:57","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":"$0","title":"Clela Errington","venue_address":"67 Front St","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Concerts &amp; Tour Dates","id":"music"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/020/582/588-7.jpeg_/clela-errington-88.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/020/582/588-7.jpeg_/clela-errington-88.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/020/582/588-7.jpeg_/clela-errington-88.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/020/582/588-7.jpeg_/clela-errington-88.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-10-20 22:37:57","venue_id":"V0-001-001059531-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"C'est What","venue_url":"http://toronto.eventful.com/venues/cest-what-/V0-001-001059531-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Toronto","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"ON","postal_code":"N5W 2Z6","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"42.9908004","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/events/defying-gravity-mega-musical-cabaret-friday-/E0-001-096693965-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096693965-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"London","link_count":null,"longitude":"-81.2249273","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Ontario","start_time":"2016-11-25 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br><br>Date:Â <br><br>Friday, November 25, 2016<br><br>Time:Â <br><br>7:00 PM (Doors Open), 8:00 PM (Curtain)<br><br>Ticket Price:Â <br><br>$30 Orchestra || $20 Balcony <br><br><p>Join MTP for an evening of Broadwayâs Biggest Blockbusters . . .<p><a href=\"https://apps.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=c35b4dc00273ed667d67ca01a79846ee&vqitq=5e73baa2-4c96-4b71-b867-ac90f01fe4de&vqitp=0ed9f999-9b95-4f18-896b-f8983b980f88&vqitts=1474393737&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=8afd43d48e694e3c0daa12167e1f348b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orchestra Tickets Â - $30 (plus service charge)</a>Â Clink link to reserve tables for either Friday or Saturday&#39;s pefromances<br><a href=\"https://apps.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=552830f13e0f0045bde9b79751d0cc74&vqitq=18e2c5bd-858b-4760-885a-c622c6f029d7&vqitp=e96908a9-979a-4153-b9a8-87987c9a6013&vqitts=1474477860&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=2745b720e96c0a5a81dd5b33d9f4be2d\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balcony Tickets - $20 (plus service charge)</a>Â Click link to get general admission balcony seatsÂ for either Friday or Saturday&#39;s Pefromance.<br><br>Â <p>&quot;Join MTP for an afternoon of Broadway&#39;s biggest blockbusters...&quot;<p>SHOWTIMES: Friday November 25 at 8pm and Saturday November 26 at 2pm AND 8pm.Â <p>Evening Shows: Doors open: 7:00pm || Curtain: 8:00pm<br>Matinee Show: Doors open: 1:00pm || Curtain: 2:00pmÂ <p>Cash Bar and Silent Auction<p>Dress Code: Cocktail Attire<p><em>DEFYING GRAVITY</em> journeys into Broadwayâs biggest musicals.

Thank you.&quot; &quot;[The participants] found it to be a unique and affirming experience given that they have been in the minority for the bullk of their education and professional careers and haven&#39;t necessarily had the luxury of spending time talking with a female peer group. Many were surprised to discover how valuable it was to be in this stimulating and safe environment where women were free to talk about the challenges associated with their professions, and to hear from others as to how they are navigating this challenging and sometimes lonely landscape.&quot; FAQ: Is the workshop only for women in Science, Engineering, Trades and Technology?

project. In this 2-dayScaled Professional Scrum (SPS) workshop, students will simulate a large software development project using the Nexusâ¢ framework. The workshop is delivered using an end-to-end case study where students work together to organize and simulate a scaled software development project. Throughout the workshop, students will be introduced to more than 50 practices that can be used to help reduce complexity and dependencies at scale.\n\nThe workshop will provide students with an understanding of how to launch, structure, staff, and manage a large Agile project using Scrum. Throughout the workshop, students will learn the infrastructure, tools and practices needed to successfully scale Scrum to maximize the value of their software development initiative.\n\nBy taking a hands-on approach, students are fully engaged in the learning process where they see first-hand the challenges in large scale development initiatives and solutions for getting the work back on track. They will leave the workshop with techniques to detect irregularities and how to address them appropriately.\n\nScrum.org maintains the defined curriculum and materials taught by our 160+ Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to assure consistency and quality for students worldwide.\n\nCourse Topics\n\n\tScaled Scrum is still Scrum\n\tIntroduction to the Nexus Framework\n\tNew role, artifacts and events\n\tOrganizing teams &amp; work\n\tManaging the Nexus &amp; Nexus+â¢\n\tDealing with common challenges\n\tPractices to help teams efficiently build an\n\tintegrated software product\n\t\n\nAssessments\nAll participants completing the Scaled Professional Scrum course will receive a password to attempt the SPS assessment.
