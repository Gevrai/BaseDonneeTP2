When a Christian learns to hear God’s voice for themselves a natural and logical progression is to hear God’s voice for others so the family of God will be - encouraged, strengthened and comforted (I Corinthians 14:3). Hearing God’s voice for others is what the Bible calls the gift and ministry of prophecy. The art of hearing God’s voice for oneself and others is best practiced with discernment, good stewardship, in a community of believers and in alignment with God’s Word. The purpose of the Deeper I learning experience is to provide an environment for you to learn about and to practice hearing God’s voice for oneself and for others. Our times together will involve worship, teaching, and practical exercises. The teaching sessions will include the following topics: Abiding in Jesus Engaging with Holy Spirit Ways that God Speaks Continuing to Grow in Hearing God’s Voice Stewarding Truth Dreams Old and New Testament Prophecy and Prophets Operating in the Purity of the Gift of Prophecy How to Give a Prophetic Word to Others How to Steward Prophetic Words that Others have Given to You Words of Wisdom & Words of Knowledge Facilitator: Deanna Oelke Start Date: September 15, 2016 End Date: December 8, 2016, 2 times a month Start Time and End Time: 6:45 – 9:30 PM ","modified":"2016-08-16 10:33:39","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":null,"title":"Deeper 1: Prophetic Gifting and Ministry Today","venue_address":"3900 2 Street NE","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":"daily until December 8, 2016","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp; Miscellaneous","id":"other"}]},"image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/715/219-8.jpeg_/deeper-1-prophetic-gifting-and-ministr-19.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/031/715/219-8.jpeg_/deeper-1-prophetic-gifting-and-ministr-19.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/715/219-8.jpeg_/deeper-1-prophetic-gifting-and-ministr-19.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/031/715/219-8.jpeg_/deeper-1-prophetic-gifting-and-ministr-19.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-16 10:33:39","venue_id":"V0-001-001716258-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Centre Street Church","venue_url":"http://calgary.eventful.com/venues/centre-street-church-/V0-001-001716258-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Toronto","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"ON","postal_code":"M5M 1S7","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"43.7309","groups":null,"url":"http://toronto.eventful.com/events/north-toronto-theatre-art-/E0-001-095442399-6@2016111017?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095442399-6@2016111017","privacy":"1","city_name":"Toronto","link_count":null,"longitude":"-79.4039","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Ontario","start_time":"2016-11-10 17:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" This Fall the students will be working on the play &quot;Who&#39;s Story Is This?&quot; Something has gone wrong in the land of Fairy Tales and all the characters are in the wrong stories!

Begins Sept. 15, 2016 Limited to 25 students   Course Location: University of Alberta Edmonton, Alberta Building: NREF Classroom: NRE 2 020 Nearest Parking off 116 ST NW: Faculty Club Parking ($2) Windsor Car Park ($5; 110V plug in) WHO SHOULD TAKE THE COURSE? Personnel who do not have formal knowledge of metallurgy and materials concepts. Those interested in understanding how deeper understanding of materials can lead to better productivity. People involved in asset integrity, pipeline integrity, operating facilities, and any other industry that makes use of materials. Practical familiarity with high school chemistry and physics is advantageous. Please bring a scientific calculator to this course. This course is a valuable pre-requisite for taking more technically challenging courses for further career development; ASM Edmonton also offers courses in Corrosion and Failure Analysis, among others.   Course INSTRUCTORS The course instructors are prominent professors and instructors at the University of Alberta with years of experience teaching.   Venue and Dates The program will run from 6-9PM for 14 weeks starting Thursday, Sept. 15th and run every week until December 15th, 2016. The course material has 14 lessons, so there will be one lesson about every week.  The lessons have been developed by ASM International and their average length is about 25 pages so it will take approximately one hour for the participants to read the lesson in preparation for the next lecture. The University of Alberta has many top notch classroom facilities. Parking is located at either the Faculty Club Parking Lot off 116 ST NW for $2/night after 4:30 PM or Windsor Car Park off 116 ST NW for $5/night after 4:30 PM. The University is also conveniently accessed by transit.   COSTS AND BENEFITS The program fee for this course will be $1200 for ASM members, $1300 non-members, and $500 for Students.  The program fee includes the course notes from ASM International and professional membership in ASM International if you are not already a member (a US$117 value).  If you took this course at ASM headquarters in their 5 day format the course alone would cost over $2,000, plus travel to and lodging in Ohio. If you or your staff want to upgrade your knowledge through continuing education we encourage you to enroll now. It will be at least two years before we will be able to repeat this course. Successful completion of the course will include an internationally recognized completion certificate. The course includes online exams, which will help you master the materials and to keep you on track in your learning.   WHAT YOU’LL LEARN Describe how metals and behave, and why; including why and how they can be formed.
