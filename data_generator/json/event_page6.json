Drawing on the rich teachings of Buddhist masters and his life experiences in the east and west, Kushok will provide commentary and lead students in meditations designed to help you gain experience in how to develop an analytical approach to meditation.\n\nJoin us for this 7-week course to learn how to use the power of a focused mind to analyze habitual ingrained patterns of thought, philosophical points, and other aspects of the path. Analytical meditation is critical for enhancing the benefits of calm abiding meditation and vice versa. The two forms of meditation are complementary. Calm Abiding cultivates the ability to focus single-pointedly and Analytical meditation uses this clarity of mind to examine various states of mind and points of philosophy. Once the mind has gained certainty on the points being examined then the meditator switches back to Calm Abiding and rests the mind in that certainty. Through this alternation of the two practices one&#39;s meditation continually deepens.\n\nThe course runs 7:00-8:30 pm every Tuesday from Nov 1 to Dec 13 at Gaden Samten Ling’s Alberta Centre for Peace & Meditation located at 11403-101 Street in Edmonton. We invite you to stay afterward for tea, visiting with classmates, a browse of the bookstore, or a visit to our member’s library.\n\nCourse fee $80. Registration & payment deadline October 25, 2016.

Penny Parry likes to play with ideas.  Her work is based in photography and narrative.  For many years, she has struggled with how to present her work and in doing so, has become more and more interested in the form and function of the book as a physical object.  In undertaking this exploration, the question of the impact of losing this particular experience evolved.

We call this the ‘critical socialization window’. What they experience in this period determines how adaptable, calm and confident they’ll be as adults. This class is broken up into two different age groups to accommodate different developmental levels: Tots and Tweeners. We’ll help you to socialize your puppy to new people, dogs, sights and sounds in a safe and positive environment. Learn how to encourage appropriate behaviour and set boundaries. Get a solid start on the most important skills a dog needs, such as bite inhibition, recall, down, house training, appropriate dog-dog skills and more. Build a strong relationship with your puppy based on mutual trust and respect! Requirements: Tots for puppies to start between 10 – 15 weeks of age who have had their second set of vaccinations. Tweeners for puppies to start between 16-20 weeks of age who have had their second set of vaccinations. Classes are 45 minutes long and run continuously. Start the first week your dog is vaccinated and keep coming back for 5 consecutive weeks. $209 for non-members, $190 for CHS members, seniors and dogs rescued from shelters or other rescue organizations (including CHS, Animal Services, ARF, etc.) Fees are non-refundable.

I don’t think so.”… Yet it sparks something in you that resonates deeply but you brush it aside. Or perhaps it has been a secret desire you have had for years but you don’t know how or where to begin. Maybe you are already in the midst of writing a book, blog, play or short story, but can’t seem to stay focused, so you stop.  Putting your voice out into the world in the form of a published work is a big deal. It’s a reflection of you—your imagination, thoughts, opinions, and often your tender heart!  If you are not used to being “out there” it can actually be terrifying.  Junie is an  author, playwright, and writing coach and for over 20 years she has also been working as a  psychotherapist. So along with her expertise in coaching writers to find their voice, become better writers and author books, she holds a sacred space for whatever emotional issues may arise throughout the writing and sharing process. What You Can Expect Weekly for 10 weeks, you will gather together with other writers to read and discuss what you have been working on for the past week—a chapter, an introduction, or something you are re-working. Even if you haven’t written anything that week, you will not be overlooked. I will work with you and discuss what may be holding you back and formulate strategies to move forward. A Holistic Experience: Students experience this program as above and beyond author support. Instead it is a sacred circle. It is an environment that at the same time you are being mentored in the craft of writing,  your heart is also held in the highest esteem.  Feedback: Everyone receives feedback from other group members and Junie. The feedback is always given with kindness and respect. It is specific, offering clarity about what’s working, what is not; what could use re-writing or tweaking—regarding characters, continuity, redundancy, length, believability etc. Are you speaking in the right voice for your audience, for your characters if it is fiction? Are you skimming the surface, needing to go deeper in order to get the reader fully involved—to make it compelling?  Do you use any of these reasons (excuses) to stop yourself from writing? It’s already been written There are already enough books on the subject I don’t want to hurt anyone Who am I to say this? I’m not an authority I’m afraid of peoples’ judgments I don’t know how to write I can’t spell I’m too old to start now; it’s too late It will take too long It’s too difficult You’re Not Alone! These common concerns will be dispelled right off the bat! Why be mentored by Junie Swadron? Junie has successfully coached thousands of writers, many of whom have become authors. In the process, they have also found their authentic voices which, in many cases, had been silenced for years. Things came full circle for her when  she wrote and published Re-Write Your Life and received a beautiful endorsement from her creative mentor, Julia Cameron, Author of The Artist’s Way “Junie Swadron is both a guide and a muse. Her book is a bright lantern, illuminating the often dark and tricky terrain of the soul. Grounded in personal experience, her techniques catalyze the deep authenticity possible to us all.” Here are 2 scenarios. Which one will YOU choose? 1st SCENARIO You want to write a book You don’t know how or where to begin You don’t think you are good enough There are things you know about and care about You are hesitant to say them out loud You are afraid of what people might think or say There are other reasons too You begin to shrink You stop Your dream ENDS here. 2nd SCENARIO You want to write a book You don’t know how or where to begin There are things you know and care about You are hesitant to say them out loud You are afraid of what people might think or say There are other reasons too Still, you say to yourself, “I am willing to feel the discomfort, put my fears aside and GO FOR IT.” Your dream BEGINS here. AND YOU WON&#39;T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE! It will be my joy and privilege to guide you right to the finish line. Love, Junie  “Your soul meets you on the page and something shifts. You strengthen. You begin to stand taller. And soon you begin to notice that your voice on the page has become your voice in the world.” Junie Swadron TESTIMONIALS  “Junie, it seems so simple and natural when you do it, but I don’t know anyone who hears and says back so clearly when I read my writing or speak my truth. You are the mirror who shines a light in the darkness just when I’ve convinced myself to give up, again. Thank you.”~Susan Beach “I had the opportunity to attend Junie Swadron’s Author Mentorship Program earlier this year. My manuscript, Julia’s Secret, had been stuck in a drawer for a couple of years at that time. I received amazing support and guidance from Junie and from the group. Junie is a wonderful facilitator—honest and heartfelt. The sessions were full of fun and extremely encouraging. Julia’s Secret is now finished and just waiting for the illustrations! My blog is out there too. The Author Mentorship Program was a brilliant kick starter. I recommend it 100%—with all my heart”    ~Anne Sture “When I began the group I was feeling stuck and uninspired. The weekly meetings provided the impetus to work on new material which created momentum (and progress). The support and feedback of the group was invaluable, making reflections available for writing still fresh on the page, applauding the successes and lovingly calling for more if the best was yet unwritten.”  ~Rob Mason “I participated in a writer’s support group with Junie and as I reflect back it still strikes me how much of a healing process it was. I thought I was joining a writing group which would give me some more writing tools to add to my belt, but I was pleasantly surprised, and I got much much more than that! This 8-week course was a catalyst for my leap of health that I find myself now. I can now stand lounging in this stronger place, enjoying the serenity that comes after releasing more of the layers of pain, after finding my way to healthier routines and habits. Junie’s programme helped me to see that indeed I have writing skills and gifts and it motivated me to pick up the pen and move on some projects that have been lying dormant for years. I am so grateful that Junie is honouring her gifts and sharing this with the world. The people that she attracts to the group are just as powerful, compassionate and inspiring as she is! Like attracts like. I feel honoured that I was in the same circle with such talented and creative people. Thanks Junie!     ~Kelly Terbasket “The Author Mentorship Program provided me with the encouragement and support to find my voice on paper and believe in it! Junie is a compassionate, skilled, intuitive and gentle facilitator… Amazing! Thank you!”    ~Pauline Karch “My Victoria Bench by Bench writings started before the book was even considered. Junie Swadron’s workshops nudged me back into a habit of writing. June’s special talent for facilitating writing groups pulled the words out of me. I started writing, not only for myself, but to share with others.”   ~Rebecca Kennel “The Author Mentorship Program has been a very nurturing environment to hatch my fledgling play and gradually take the steps to learn to fly. A great environment to meet others of like mind.“   ~Amy Robertson  “I loved being in the safe container of the Author Mentorship Program. The words of encouragement and wisdom from June and my sister writers were like powerful medicine, inspiring me to write and then write some more. I look forward to continuing and meeting more writers in the September group.”  ~Monica Kingsbury  “I am extremely privileged to have the opportunity of working with Junie as my writing coach as a prelude to the launch of a book or books in progress. I have personally experienced her magnificent facilitation and Junie’s gentle, yet powerful leadership skills propel all into a sacred space of acknowledgement, acceptance, safety and unleashed creativity. Junie’s processes guided by integrity, authenticity and absolute kindness create an atmosphere for raucous fun as well as ‘sacred reverence’. One of the most important gifts that I’ve received from Junie is learning to honour the sacred process of connecting with and expressing my own unique voice.”   ~Jeraldine Estin “As a writer working on my first book, I found June’s suggestions invaluable. Writing can be lonely work; her approach encouraged a strong bonding and mutual support among the group members. Especially helpful were tips on how to still the negative inner critic and how to break through writer’s block. I highly recommend The Author Mentorship Program.”  ~Ella Brown “Your love, friendship, advice and support encouraged me to finally birth this work of fiction, so long in gestation.”  ~Julia Joldersma LIMITED TO 10 PARTICIPANTS Advance Registration Recommended!

To create a unique work of art in addition to personal inventiveness and imagination, competence, and knowledge makes it possible to bring that work to another level. The course combines theory and practice and aims to expose participants to various art movements which students will “resolve” in their own distinctive creations. Together we will explore how the Old Masters manipulated light and dark, as well as colour and space (especially as practiced during the Baroque period) and compare it with the momentous and a far reaching changes introduced by the Impressionist. We will also explore how “space” was historically resolved on a flat surface and how the twentieth century contemporary artists were keen to negate this, imaginary volume and depth. This course will satisfy a traditionalist as well as a more informal artist keen to experiment. This course will motivate participants’ ability and talent while increasing their skill and knowledge. There will be plenty of time for discussions, class interactions, but also ample “hands on” painting periods. Theoretical portions will be illustrated by visual projections (Power Point presentations).This is an equal opportunity class opened to beginners and advance students; we will all learn from each other.

It does not tolerate mistakes very well, and trying to recover from them is mostly useless. However, a fast evolving modern technology has also affected the paint industry, creating new materials and changing and altering the properties of existing ones. As a result the medium of watercolour has also changed, allowing it to be much more forgiving and versatile, opening up exciting new opportunities to play and experiment with it much more freely. This course is designed for those ready to “let watercolour loose”, painting outdoors in the Bluffs when weather allows and from own sketches and notes when in the studio. Learn hands-on how to turn “mistakes” into desirable effects, while taking the journey into the unknown watercolour territory. It is recommended that you carry and use a sketchbook and a HB pencil at all times. We will look at important watercolour work of traditional as well as work by some contemporary artists.

The championships will take place from March 10-12, 2017 at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga, Ont. Twenty-five of the top junior synchronized skating teams from 20 countries will compete for the junior world title.<p>&quot;It is always an honour to host international events and we are excited to be hosting the ISU World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships for the first time,&quot; said Dan Thompson, CEO, Skate Canada. &quot;Canada has a fantastic track record of hosting synchronized skating events. Most recently we hosted the 2015 ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships which was an extremely exciting event with Canada winning gold on home soil. We look forward to hosting the world once again in 2017.&quot;<p>The ISU World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships was a biennial event but it was recently decided at the 2016 ISU Congress that the event will become annual beginning in 2017.
