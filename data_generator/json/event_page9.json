Their original songs feature sophisticated harmonies, body percussion, scintillating dance moves, humour and just enough ooh-la-la to charm your socks off! Along with whoops, hollers, and mile-wide smiles, they create a sound and sight that is lighthearted and captivating for all music lovers.They are inspired by Rosie the Riveter, the feminist icon who represents the womens movement into the workforce during WWII and embodies the strength and power that thrive in every woman. The Riveters are about empowering women to be ambassadors for change in their community and to attain this goal, they use 20% of their merchandise sales to support other womens projects around the world through KIVA.org.Since the bands formation in 2011, they have quickly taken the folk scene by storm! They have performed over 150 concerts across Canada and the United States, showcased at such events as Folk Alliance International, JunoFest, Folk Music Canada, been featured at numerous festivals and participated in workshops with artists such as Serena Ryder, Arlo Guthrie, The Bros. Landreth, and Kat Danser.Alexis Normand, Allyson Reigh, Melissa Nygren, and Farideh Olsen are the charming women who make up Rosie & the Riveters.","modified":"2016-10-13

excuse to stay stuck, remain indecisive and keep others comfortable, at the expense of our own individual happiness and potential. The outcome of this conversation was that many of us took the question &quot;What is your Big Lie&quot; with us to dinner parties, networking events, coffee dates and family dinners. The stories that came forth, the truths that were discovered and the connections that were made were astounding and remarkable. We were so excited by the conversations, ideas and movement forward that we witnessed that the logical next step was to offer this conversation, AND a solution to a larger audience of Women and Men.   So.... What is your Big Lie?   * The Big Lie is a story you have adopted as the truth, so you act it out on a daily basis and keep hitting replay. * Playing out your Big Lie keeps you small, stuck and on repeat instead of moving forward into your truth. * Your Big Lie can negativley infiltrate your relationships, career and even your passions or true path.   Often, on the other side of your Biggest Lie, lives your greatest gift and calling.

They are a study in contrasts; Cara, all earth mother on her 21-speed bike, helmet and backpack, environmentally friendly and wholesome, ebullient and engaging; and burly JD, looking like a cross between a biker and long-haul trucker in scruffy beard, ball cap, t-shirt and jean jacket, slightly intimidating (until you meet him). At first glance few would peg them for a highly creative musical partnership. Yet these two veteran singer/songwriters have teamed up and are building a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity and visceral performances. Luft is a <strong>Juno award winner</strong>, co-founder of folk trio <b>The Wailin’ Jennys</b>, and a touring road warrior. She has earned a solid reputation as an exciting live performer, accomplished guitarist, clawhammer banjo player and insightfully honest songwriter. Edwards has a voice that defies categorization, one that easily ranges from gentle and melodic to fierce and powerful, leaving listeners begging for more. He is truly one of the finest singers of his time.

A madman and an earnest poet. A strummer of delicate chords and a lover of bent and broken melodies. Ben Caplan is not any one thing. As he releases his second album, he&#39;s already gained a following in more than a dozen countries from Australia to Europe and across North America. It&#39;s no surprise. Caplan is simply unforgettable; with his huge beard and unruly mane, he is as visually striking as he is aurally compelling. His rough and textured tones cut through crowded halls; an enormous voice, roaring louder than raucous crowds. The microphone looks almost superfluous. But looks are deceiving; once he has your attention, Caplan can croon smoother than a glass of single malt whisky, pouring beauty into a harsh world. Inspired in part by Eastern European and Jewish folk traditions, Ben Caplan mixes older musical sensibilities with his own soul, straight from his hairy heart. Lyrically, you&#39;ve not heard the like before. Often edgy and dark, Caplan holds a mirror up to show us our nasty bits, singing about the ugliness and showing us that this darkness is the root of the sublime. His new album, Birds with Broken Wings, explodes with sounds both ancient and modern, with more than 30 musicians and even more instruments, combining acoustic sounds from around the world. It&#39;s all smoothly blended by the hottest international production team around. It&#39;s uncharted territory, and Caplan&#39;s leading the way.<p><br> </p></p>","modified":"2016-10-01 08:57:00","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"evdb","linker":"evdb","name":"Ben Caplan and The Casual Smokers","url":"http://eventful.com/performers/ben-caplan-and-the-casual-smokers-/P0-001-007119266-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-007119266-5","short_bio":null}},"price":null,"title":"Ben Caplan and the Casual Smokers","venue_address":"795 Dundas Street East","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp;

Canada Council Arts Grants subsequently enabled her to study in Paris with Marcel Ciampi. Other teachers included Cecile Genhart in Zurich and Ozan Marsh in Chautauqua.<p>She has won numerous awards and  competitions, has soloed with orchestras in Canada and the U.S. and recorded several CBC programs as soloist and chamber musician. <p>Always principally a classical artist, she has excelled in other genres as well, putting herself through university partly by playing in a professional swing band, and over the years gaining a varied background in musical theatre as well as performing hundreds of chamber recitals and playing with Orchestra London for many years. She maintains a consistently full studio of piano students ranging in age and level, enjoying teaching and making the main priority always expression insisting that one learn to express rather than just impress.<p>She and Clark Bryan have enjoyed playing together over many years on the same keyboard and as a piano duo. As Clark said  in one interview &quot;we fit like a glove&quot;.<p>In his youth<strong> CLARK BRYAN</strong> trained with longtime pupil of the renowned pianist Géza Anda, Antonia Mazanova. She helped him gain an appreciation for music of all styles. Mr. Bryan did his formal training at the University of Western Ontario.  In 1992 he graduated with both Bachelor and Masters Degrees in piano performance.<p>Mr. Bryan has worked with many of the world’s renowned pianists including Howard Shelley, Jean Paul, Sevilla, Eugene List, Shura Cherkasky, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Ruth Slenczynska and Ronald Turini. Mr. Bryan spent many years working with the celebrated pianist Cécile Ousset both in Paris and the south of France where he refined much of his pianistic and interpretive abilities.<p>Clark’s performance career has taken him to Europe, Mexico the United States and throughout Canada. He has done performances for CBC radio and television including a broadcast recital in 2002 at the Glenn Gould Studio, CBC. He has adjudicated music festivals from St. John’s to Vancouver.  Mr. Bryan has done extensive music editing including the New Millennium Piano Series for Conservatory Canada.  A recent project of note is a book entitled:  “Gateways to Learning and Memory” published in 2009.<p>Mr. Bryan has recorded eleven albums of solo piano and a duo piano album of the Suites for two pianos by Serge Rachmaninoff with duo partner Marion Miller.  His most recent recordings include the complete Chopin Nocturnes.<p>In 2004, Mr. Bryan purchased the Aeolian Performing Arts Centre and School of Music, a magnificent acoustic marvel in London, Ontario. This hall was built in 1883 as the Town Hall for East London and has a rich musical history. In 2009 he shifted the governance of the Aeolian into a registered chariy.  The Hall was  awarded “Best Live Venue in London” (Jack Richardson Music Awards)three times and “Top 10 Venues in Canada” (CBC radio 3).  In April 2011, Mr. Bryan was awarded a Jack Richardson Music Award in the “Contributor” category for his contributions to the musical landscape in the London Community.  In 2011, Mr. Bryan launched El Sistema at the Aeolian, a free UNESCO award winning music program for children and youth.  In January 2016, Mr. Bryan with the approval of his Board of Directors open a new education campus at Bishop Cronyn Memorial Place.  This new home for the El Sistema Aeolian program will also include many other educational programs soon to be implemented.  This new facility also includes a beautiful historic church facility for more artistic presentation.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-09-03 17:36:40","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":null,"title":"Our Favourite Things - Marion Miller & Clark Bryan","venue_address":"795 Dundas Street East","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Other &amp;

Fraser In this course students will explore the magical world of children’s book Illustration. They will learn how to research, design, and write a children’s book while having a blast doing it. They will create their own characters, backgrounds and props through careful instruction. They will learn the elements of what makes a good story and learn resourceful ways of presentation through instruction.

For this performance, Frisells choice of material may roam freely from his own original compositions, to his inimitable take on all forms of American vernacular music. This night should be a required listening for all guitar players and lovers of music. &quot;Its hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, hes found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other putschists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in music and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness.&quot; The New York Times&quot;Frisell is without a doubt, the single most important guitarist in jazz, a genius who is going to have the kind of influence on his instrument Jimi Hendrix and Wes Montgomery had before him &quot;

Starman will be presented as a songwriters-in-the-round format, with lead vocals split evenly among band members. Cox has recruited a solid cast of professional musicians, including Juno award-winning singer/songwriter Helen Austin, and Shaun Verreault of Wide Mouth Mason. Other band members include Cox’s long-time collaborator Sam Hurrie, Linda McRae (Spirit of the West), percussionist Robin Layne (Locarno) and Canadian bassist extraordinaire Rick May. Members of the all-star band chose Bowie songs that were meaningful to them, and the results cover his entire career — up to and including a song from his last album, Blackstar, which was released January 2016. Join an inspired, diverse group of Canadian singers/musicians as they celebrate the songs of Bowie in this in-the-round concert performance. <p> General admission: $35 Student/Senior/Alumni: $25 General 4-Pack: $100 </p></p>","modified":"2016-10-06 12:03:11","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"price":null,"title":"Starman: Acoustic Bowie","venue_address":null,"geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Neighborhood","id":"community"}]},"image":null,"created":"2016-10-06 12:03:11","venue_id":"V0-001-005589506-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2017-02-08 00:00:00","venue_name":"University Centre Farquhar Auditorium","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/venues/university-centre-farquhar-auditorium-/V0-001-005589506-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Toronto","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"ON","postal_code":"M6J 1V3","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"43.6519","groups":null,"url":"http://toronto.eventful.com/events/mama-ladilla-progressive-punks-tour-madrid-spain-/E0-001-096960791-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096960791-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Toronto","link_count":null,"longitude":"-79.4081","country_name":"Canada","country_abbr":"CAN","region_name":"Ontario","start_time":"2016-12-10 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-10-05 18:00:53","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"Yespy","linker":"evdb","name":"Mama Ladilla","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Mama-Ladilla?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000176717-4","short_bio":null}},"price":null,"title":"Mama Ladilla (Progressive Punks On Tour From Madrid Spain)","venue_address":"824 Dundas Street West","geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"free":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"CA","categories":{"category":[{"name":"Concerts &amp;

Joint Mobility & Body Weight training have been a part of the Agatsu system since its inception. Through years of study of various health and martial arts systems, yoga, dance and gymnastics, Shawn Mozen has partnered with Sara-Clare Lajeunesse to create an active and effective joint mobility program that has become the corner stone to all of their training. With the simple idea that we must first learn to master our own bodies before we can learn to overcome the resistance offered by weights, the Agatsu Joint Mobility & Movement program was born. LOWER BODY- Level 1, you will learn: Progressions to developing a rock bottom squat, below 90 degrees. Squatting deep isn’t out of reach if you know what’s stopping you from getting there. Learn how to safely and effectively take the Squat apart and built it from the ground up for any client. Why you should be complementing your Squat training with Dead Lifts and how to safely perform many excellent variations of this great exercise. Why single leg strength training is a must. Explore lunges, Hawaiian Squat, Pistols, Split Squats, Cossack and other single leg variations and how they correct muscle imbalances and help you gain greater control and strength in sports and weight training. How, why, when and where should you use Joint Mobility in your training? Explore the fundamentals of joint mobility and joint preparation training and the essential roles they play in warm-up and injury prevention. Bullet proof your lower body. Stop hurting yourself in training and start building a stronger more resilient body. Learn how to safely and incrementally train in positions of disadvantage to gain greater stability within your joints. Work on specific exercises and flow drills to aid the lower back, hips, knees and ankles to gain greater range of motion and help relieve joint pain. Train without pain! Learn how to deal with and help remove stalls in joint ranges of motion through the use of self -massage, fascial stretch and Adaptive Bodywork techniques. Build on progressions to basic rolling, falling and balance exercises without the use of your upper body. Develop your flexibility and greater range of motion through dynamic and loaded stretching progressions for the lower body and lumbar spine. Understand and create a sound pre-workout joint mobility and joint preparation warm up, as well as develop a post training stretching and self-massage practice. To help you take notes and organize the large amount of material we suggest that you purchase a copy of the e-book located in our store.
