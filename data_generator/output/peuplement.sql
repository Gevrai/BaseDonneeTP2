Whether it’s traditional favourites like “Silent Night” and “What Child Is This?” or Quartette originals such as “The Perfect Christmas Tree” and “Hope, Peace, Joy and Love”, Canadian singer/songwriters Cindy Church, Caitlin Hanford, Gwen Swick and Sylvia Tyson enchant with their singularly lush harmonies, unique arrangements and rich variety of musical influences.<br><br>The genesis of Quartette was happenstance … a “songwriter in the round” showcase of Canadian women songwriters hosted by Toronto’s Harbourfront Centre in 1993. What began as a concert of musical friends grew into an inspired collaboration, generating public and critical acclaim, and catching the ear of Peter Gzowski, who invited them to perform on his CBC Radio show Morningside. Later Gzowski would say of that performance: “The CBC switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree with people looking for a recording!” Seven months later they released their self-titled album. Since then, Quartette has released five more recordings – two of them Christmas collections, garnered multiple Juno nominations, won the Canadian Country Music Award for best vocal collaboration, performed with major symphonies across Canada, been repeat guests on Garrison Keillor’s A Prairie Home Companion, recorded a CMT-TV Christmas special and of course continued to tour the country, either in support of their most recent release or for their ever-popular Christmas performances.<br><br>Laughter, refreshing arrangements of old and new, impeccable harmonies, tales of love and inspiration, four lovely ladies celebrating 23 years of musical friendship … “A Quartette Christmas.” <br><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Music, Holiday<br><strong>Language: </strong>English<br><strong>Tickets: </strong>$47.50 <br><a></a><p><a href="http://ev7.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ACP%3AC1617%3ACT1222C%3A&linkID=centrepointe&shopperContext=&pc=&caller=&appCode=&groupCode=CCPT&cgc=" rel="nofollow">December 22 at 7:30 pm</a><br></p></p></p></p>", "http://ottawa.eventful.com/events/quartette-christmas-/E0-001-074026656-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '01:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, NULL);

Hot on the heels of the sell-out success of Darcy Oake, we welcome another home-grown illusionist full of fantastic tricks and loads of laughs along the way. <p> <p>Murray made waves on the small screen, impressing judges with his incredible feats and slick showmanship.

With a clown-like mop of spiky white hair and a charming-but-mischievous smile, it’s easy to forget that Murray won dozens of awards and was crowned a world champion in the magic community even before he set out to dominate reality television, Las Vegas, and multiple world tours.

Each painting of Sarfeld’s functions as a fresh page in her artistic journal, she uses the canvas to fuel her daily curiosity in one-way or another. Seeing each canvas as a new piece of work is a large part of her practice. To forget and start fresh, and to learn from each painting as she creates, usually working on one or two simultaneously. 
 
Stop by to relax after a busy week at work and get to know other creative and active members of your local community. Whether you&#39;re a friend, our neighbour, brand new to the city or just looking to connect with others in Vancouver, join us on the last Friday of the month.

They get an error stating &quot;SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error&quot;, or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? We will walk through two corrupt databases, exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly, we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time. Speaker: Steve Stedman is the leader of the Bellingham PASS Chapter in WA, USA.

(170, "Mayhem", " with Inquisition, Black Anvil<br> Mayhem are a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1984 in Oslo long regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem&#39;s career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (&quot;Dead&quot;) and 1993 murder of guitarist ystein Aarseth (&quot;Euronymous&quot;) by former member Varg Vikernes (&quot;Count Grishnackh&quot;), also of Burzum.The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth&#39;s murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (&quot;Hellhammer&quot;), Jrn Stubberud (&quot;Necrobutcher&quot;) and Sven Erik Kristiansen (&quot;Maniac&quot;) reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (&quot;Blasphemer&quot;) replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar since replaced Kristiansen.The band&#39;s music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the wider metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. Mayhem&#39;s most recent album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for Best Metal Album in 2007.", "http://edmonton.eventful.com/events/mayhem-/E0-001-097321611-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '48:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, NULL);

(177, "The Weepies", " <br> Singer-songwriters Deb Talan & Steve Tannen began writing together the night they met, and soon formed indie band The Weepies. On the strength of their simple yet insightful songwriting and distinctive harmonies, they quietly sold more than a million records, with over 17 million streams on Spotify, and 20 million views on YouTube. They married and had three children, rarely touring but continuing to release their music, five records over seven years.Just before Christmas 2013, when their youngest son was 17 months old, Deb Talan was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. She was in chemo by New Year&#39;s Eve.In 2014, Deb beat cancer, and The Weepies recorded the best album of their career. Coming back from the edge sharpened their skills and focus. At 16 songs and almost an hour long, SIRENS shows a band at the height of its powers.The couple was unable to travel while Deb was in treatment, so they worked at home, inviting guest musicians to record remotely wherever each musician happened to be, resulting in an unlikely superstar backing band. Players from across the spectrum jumped in, including: Pete Thomas and Steve Nieve (Elvis Costello), Gerry Leonard (David Bowie), Rami Jaffee (Foo Fighters), Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel), Oliver Kraus (Sia) and Matt Chamberlain (Pearl Jam), as well as veteran Weepies compatriots Frank Lenz, Eli Thomson, Jon Flaugher, Meg Toohey, and Whynot Jansveld, plus a horn section from New Orleans.The prophetic &quot;No Trouble&quot; was written prior to learning Deb&#39;s diagnosis. &quot;I don&#39;t need no trouble, but sometimes trouble needs me,&quot; sings Steve; Deb&#39;s vocals were recorded during her first weeks of chemo. The couple continued to write and record throughout treatment, with Deb providing several key vocals far into the year, including title track &quot;Sirens,&quot; captured in one take on a day where Deb really only had one take in her; her vulnerability is tangible. &quot;We just kept going,&quot; says Deb. &quot;We also have 3 small children, and were homeschooling, and the effects of chemo blew whole days out of the water.&quot;The band was able to use their limited studio time as an escape, leading to some of their most joyful tracks ever, including the genre-bending &quot;Fancy Things&quot; and the upbeat &quot;Early Morning Riser,&quot; aided mightily by a fantastic rhythm section and horns. There&#39;s plenty of heart and comfort for long time Weepies fans too the deceptively simple &quot;My Little Love,&quot; the gorgeous &quot;Brand New Pair of Wings&quot; and the straight ahead poetry of &quot;River From the Sky.&quot;After The Weepies had officially finished the album, and Deb was in recovery, they continued to record remotely with their phenomenal backing musicians for fun, eventuallyadding a cover of Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and a version of Irish balladeer Mark Geary&#39;s &quot;Volunteer&quot; to the final album.&quot;No one song could capture that year,&quot; says Steve. &quot;16 seems like a lot to release at once, but each song reflects a different angle of that long, suspended moment. They hang together like a bunch of photographs from a certain time. It was intense, but there was beauty and inspiration, too. Deb made it back. And we&#39;re still here.&quot;SIRENS will be released by Nettwerk worldwide on April 28, 2015.", "http://toronto.eventful.com/events/weepies-/E0-001-096645531-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '01:30:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, NULL);

However, Rodgers left early in their development to form another local punk attraction, the Adolescents. His replacement was James Levesque.The band&#39;s first important supporter was KROQ disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, who was fundamental to the promotion of many similar outfits. Their debut release, the Bloodstains EP, was the only one to feature Rodgers, and its title track was the first song the fledgling band wrote. Afterwards, they signed to prominent local label Posh Boy Records, run by Robbie Fields. The subsequent debut album showed the band rising above the usual three-chord bluster of hardcore with a melodic approach that recalled 60s surf instrumental bands (the Ventures being the most obvious influence). However, the band stormed out of the studio near to the album&#39;s completion, complaining about being &quot;produced&#39; and Fields&#39; behaviour in general, leaving engineer David Hines and Jay Lansford (of Simpletones, Stepmothers and Channel 3 fame) to finish off the recordings. The Bitchin&#39; Summer EP was one of the first skate/surf punk crossover items, with three energized surf guitar instrumentals establishing the band&#39;s future direction. Various problems delayed the next release until the trio signed with Enigma Records for 1984&quot;s When You Least Expect It ... EP, which saw a conscious and largely unsuccessful attempt to accommodate a more disciplined, polished sound, a mistake compounded by a pointless cover version of Jefferson Airplane&#39;s &quot;Somebody To Love&#39;. However, all the elements came together for 1986&quot;s This Is The Voice - the overdriven guitar mesh now allied to first-rate songwriting and delivery. This time the cover of &quot;Dangerman&quot; was fine, but subordinate to the Agent Orange originals. Levesque had been replaced by Brent Liles (ex-Social Distortion) the previous year.Agent Orange remained largely quiet during the early part of the 90s save for a live album. Palm returned in 1996 with two new members and a studio album, Virtually Indestructible.

Scaled Professional Scrum
The Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS) Workshop will show you how to launch, structure, staff, and manage a large agile or Scrum project. In this 2-dayScaled Professional Scrum (SPS) workshop, students will simulate a large software development project using the Nexus™ framework. The workshop is delivered using an end-to-end case study where students work together to organize and simulate a scaled software development project. Throughout the workshop, students will be introduced to more than 50 practices that can be used to help reduce complexity and dependencies at scale.

The workshop will provide students with an understanding of how to launch, structure, staff, and manage a large Agile project using Scrum. Throughout the workshop, students will learn the infrastructure, tools and practices needed to successfully scale Scrum to maximize the value of their software development initiative.

By taking a hands-on approach, students are fully engaged in the learning process where they see first-hand the challenges in large scale development initiatives and solutions for getting the work back on track. They will leave the workshop with techniques to detect irregularities and how to address them appropriately.

Scrum.org maintains the defined curriculum and materials taught by our 160+ Professional Scrum Trainers (PSTs) to assure consistency and quality for students worldwide.

(527, "PLAYING WITH CHOIR", " Do you love to sing (even though you might not consider yourself “a singer” or only feel comfortable singing alone in the car)? Singing in a group has significant benefits whether you’re on key or not – science says it’s like “an infusion of the perfect tranquilizer, the kind that both soothes your nerves and elevates your spirits.” PLAYING WITH CHOIR is an opportunity to come together in a large group to learn simple 2 or 3 part harmonies for popular songs of today and past decades and belt them out for the simple joy of singing. No auditions, no solos, no stars, just fun. Fall 2016 Term The Fall 2016 term schedule will begin Monday, October 24 and conclude Monday, December 12. The sessions will be from 7:00 – 9:00. There will be no session on Monday, October 31 (so we can all go trick or treating). In this first term, we’ll be learning original arrangements for: Lean On Me (Bill Withers) One Fine Day (The Chiffons) Tell Him (The Exciters) Every Breath You Take (Police) Have You Ever Seen The Rain (CCR) Peaceful Easy Feeling (Eagles) Killing Me Softly (Fugees) Hey Ho (Lumineers) With Or Without You (U2)   FAQs What’s the fee? The registration fee for this initial 7-week term is $70, which covers the costs involved in creating original arrangements of the awesome songs we’ll sing, a Choir Director to teach us our parts and lead our singing, an accompanist, space, promotion, administration, communication/coordination, and printing.   How often are sessions? Each year, we aim to have Fall, Winter and Spring terms consisting of 7-10 weekly 2-hour sessions.   Who can join? If you are an adult 19+ who loves to sing and plays well with others, we’d be thrilled to welcome you to the gang. No singing experience is necessary, and you will not be required to read music. Our focus is on fun and comfort – there are no auditions and you will never have to sing alone.   What if I can&#39;t make a session? We’ll miss you. But we won’t be mad.   Does the choir perform? There are currently no plans for performance, however, there may be opportunities arise as we progress. When those opportunities do come up, they will be completely optional. Our focus truly is on coming together to sing and have fun.   What should I expect at a session? The Choir Director (the amazing Jill Chandler) will begin each session with some physical and vocal warm ups. She will focus each session on teaching one or two new songs, breaking the group into two or three sections, each learning their part of the song’s harmony. By the end of the night we’ll bring it all together in a gorgeous full-choir rendition that we’ll video so you can boast to your friends and family about how awesome you sound. While we will be expected to listen to the Choir Director, and do as she instructs, the setting will be casual and fun.  While we expect that most of the songs we’ll learn will be songs you know and love, we will give you a heads up regarding the line-up in case you want to familiarize yourself with a song before the evening begins. New songs will be added throughout the term and by the end, we’ll have a repertoire of great songs and feel like stars.   Who chooses the songs and do choir members get a say? Songs are chosen before each term begins by the admin team and we are happy to have suggestions for following terms.   Do I have to audition or sing alone? No! We’re all about fun and comfort. Skill levels and experience will vary and that’s totally cool. There will be no solos or auditions. It’s all about one voice.   What if I really can’t sing? Don’t worry! There will be so many voices, it will all come together.   Do I need to know how to read music? Nope! We’ll hand out a lyric sheet and you’ll learn the notes by listening to the director and through repetition.   Do I need singing experience? If your only singing experience is alone in the car, that’s cool with us. As long as you love to sing, you’re in.   Can I pay as I go? Sorry, in order for us to feel confident we’ll be able to cover our expenses, we require registration and payment in advance of the term.   Who are you awesome people and how did this start? Emma Fugate loves to sing, but had no outlet to do so in a group. She heard about the world-wide trend of pop choirs and lobbed the idea at a ton of people over the past two years until it stuck to one of them. She and Kirstin Lund spent the better part of a drive home from a conference in Boston scheming about how to create one in PEI. When they got home, they roped their very talented friend, singer-songwriter Jill Chandler, into partnering with them to create this cool new venture. They are all super fun.   What is the refund policy? Let us know before the first night of first term begins and we&#39;ll happily refund your registration fee or transfer it to someone else&#39;s name. Once the term begins, there will be no refunds and the registration is not transferable.   ", "http://eventful.com/events/playing-choir-/E0-001-096757797-8@2016111019?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '04:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, NULL);

The Story: In Detroit, suburbanites Ben (Joel Wirkunnen) and Mary (Jennifer Copping) fire up the backyard grill to welcome the new neighbours, recovering addicts Sharon (Luisa Jojick) and Kenny (Aaron Craven), who have moved into the long-empty house next door. The fledgling friendship soon veers out of control, shattering the fragile hold that newly unemployed Ben and burgeoning alcoholic Mary have on their way of lifewith unexpected comic consequences. We present this timely show while Vancouvers housing crisis is a hot topic and our city continues to struggle with the plight of the homeless and addicted. Detroit tackles these issues with humour and deep humanity. This play was a 2011 Pulitzer prize finalist and is a timely addition to the evolving presence of our company in the city&#39;s theatre ecology. We are so excited to bring this play to Vancouver at such a delicate and tenuous time in the city&#39;s history. With 12 Jessie nominations to its name, Mitch and Murray Productions is a theatre company that lives on the edge, with a focus on contemporary, character-driven storytelling that rocks the status quo and provokes laughter, cringing and lively debate. Recent works include the Vancouver premieres of Pulitzer Prize-nominated Rapture Blister Burn and Becky Shaw by Gina Gionfriddo, Lungs by Duncan MacMillan and Race and Speed-the-Plow by David Mamet - all contemporary urban stories, with morally complex and unpredictable characters. Making their home in the cozy confines of the intimate Studio 16, Mitch and Murray Productions has been tagged by a loyal audience base as HBO for the stage.<br> <br>

Known for their electrifying live performances the band has toured nationally and abroad, playing a moody but uplifting americana with an extensive instrumental arsenal (accordion, cello, mandolin, theremin). For the uninitiated, the band’s all-over-the-map melodic avant-folk is equal parts Washington Irving and Woodstock, tapping a broad palette of styles ranging from dusty Americana ballads to huge Pink Floydesque cinematic anthems.  “The entire root system of Rock Family Trees is embedded in Longo’s voice.”- The Big Issue, Scotland, U.K. The Slambovian Circus of Dreams have been called  “the hillbilly Pink Floyd,” which is an apt description, particularly if you throw in elements of Incredible String Band, Neil Young, The Band, Dylan, Bowie and Syd Barrett.<br><br>The band runs its own label, with 4 critically acclaimed studio albums  <a href="http://store.slambovia.com/The_Grand_Slambovians_The_New_Album_p/music-cd-grandslam.htm" rel="nofollow">“The Grand Slambovians”</a>2010, <a href="http://store.slambovia.com/The_Great_Unravel_CD_p/music-cd-greatunravel.htm" rel="nofollow">‘The Great Unravel’</a> (2008), 2004’s double-disc <a href="http://store.slambovia.com/Flapjacks_from_the_Sky_CD_p/music-cd-flapjacks.htm" rel="nofollow">‘Flapjacks from the Sky’</a>, and <a href="http://store.slambovia.com/A_Good_Thief_Tips_His_Hat_CD_p/music-cd-goodthief.htm" rel="nofollow">‘A Good Thief Tips His Hat</a>‘ (1998) in its catalogue. In 2014, ‘A Box of Everything’, was licensed to Red River/Sony Red as the band’s ‘greatest hits you’ve never heard’. The bands next studio album, ‘A Very Unusual Head’ is scheduled for release summer/fall 2016, unleashing their hauntingly signature songs on the world once again. Guests on the album will include friends and fellow New Yorkers including guitarist Gary Lucas, Willie Nile, <em>and many more</em>.  <br><p> <p><b>The Slambovian Circus of Dreams are:</b><p><b><a href="http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/JOE-XMASTC.jpg" rel="nofollow"></a></b><p><b>Joziah Longo</b> (lead vocals, guitars, harmonica), born in Philadelphia, grew up playing traditional country, folk and mummers music with his father. Performing professionally from the age of 13 doing Dylan covers, he moved to New York to pursue his muse. Playing venues ranging from CBGB’s to Carnegie Hall as a headline performer, Joziah was also the first American songwriter invited to perform in mainland China in the early 90’s, signaling the end of a decade-long ban on Western music. Since 2010 Longo has worked with Broadway’s Circle in The Square Theater in New York City. Joziah wrote the music for 2 original productions, directed by the legendary Theodore Mann and is currently working on another project with new theater director, Jonathan Mann.<p><a href="http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TINK-WNTI.jpg" rel="nofollow"><br></a>Multi-instrumentalist <b>Tink Lloyd</b> (accordion, cello, flute, theremin) comes from a long line of feisty Irish musicians which brings a spark to the band’s music as well as performance. Tink has worked with Joziah since meeting in the 1980’s.<p><b><a href="http://slambovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SHARKEY-WNTI3.jpg" rel="nofollow"></a></b><p><b>Sharkey McEwen</b> (guitars, mandolin, backing vocals), longtime musical partner of Joziah, has Louisiana roots but grew up in L.A. where he cut his teeth on the club circuit before coming to New York in the early 90’s. His inventive, evocative playing is a strong counterpoint to Joziah’s songwriting. He is has been the band’s main engineer and co-producer with Joziah since their first album.<p><p>A New York area native, <strong>Felipe Torres</strong> (drums, percussion, backing vocal) has been a musician and teacher for nearly 20 years. Having toured extensively throughout the USA, Canada and Europe, performing in a multitude of musical genres, Felipe brings a variety of drumming and color to the Slambovian world. His approach is directed and inspired by the mood and lyrical imagery conjured by the newly found musical kinship in Joziah and the band’s work.

With a surging rhythm section, razor sharp violin, and flourishing banjo and guitars, Dekker and band mates have pushed their sound significantly, creating some of their most dynamic songs ever recorded.<p>Those familiar with the decade-long output of Great Lake Swimmers will recognize the thematic threads of beauty in the natural world, environmental issues and explorations of close personal ties that hold us together. The familiar versus the strange theme is also running through this record, both in the instrumentation and in the songwriting (&quot;Zero In The City&quot;, &quot;I Was A Wayward Pastel Bay&quot;).<p>As with past Great Lake Swimmers albums, A Forest Of Arms was recorded in several locations over the span of several months, covering extensive new territory while remaining true to the group&#39;s refined sound. One of the unique and unusual locations was Tyendinaga Cavern and Caves in Tyendinaga, Ontario, where a number of the vocal and acoustic guitar tracks, including the main parts for &quot;Don&#39;t Leave Me Hanging,&quot; &quot;The Great Bear&quot; and &quot;With Every Departure,&quot; were recorded amid haunting acoustics, stalactites, and circling bats.<p>Great Lake Swimmers consists of Tony Dekker on lead vocals and guitar, long time guitarist and banjo player Erik Arnesen, Miranda Mulholland on violin and backing vocals, Bret Higgins on upright bass and newcomer Joshua Van Tassel on drums. There are several special guest appearances on the album by Kevin Kane (Grapes Of Wrath) on 12-string electric guitar, as well as backing vocals on the song &quot;A Bird Flew Inside The House.&quot;<p><p> <p><p>For their fifth album, Elliott Brood wanted to break things. 2008&#39;s Mountain Meadows was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize, and the band&#39;s last record, Days Into Years, won a 2011 Juno award for roots album of the year. Now was the time to smash the precedents, break the mould. To withdraw to a farmhouse in Bath, Ontario, hammering out nine songs in two weeks.<p>For the first time, Elliott Brood decided to work with an outside producer: Ian Blurton, who has helped make roaring records for the Weakerthans, Skydiggers and Cursed. And for the first time, the group&#39;s two songwriters decided to mine the bare histories of their own lives: penning verses about the ends of relationships and the tests of adulthood, long drives, childhood retreating in a rear-view mirror. &quot;Work and Love will make a man out of you,&quot; the Constantines sang; and so here is Elliott Brood&#39;s Work and Love, their most personal album to date, the sound of a grown-up band searching their hearts for all they&#39;ve lost and gained.<p> <p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/great-lake-swimmers-and-elliott-brood-/E0-001-096381543-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '10:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

After millions of albums sold, countless hit songs, and record breaking tours around the world, Séan realized that his 20 years with the band had to stop. Music is meant to connect, heal, and bring happiness. While Séan was giving that to thousands of people a night he was slowly losing his own way. Instead of seeking truth he was hiding behind his music. This was unfair to both himself and his fans so he left the band and started over.<p>In January 2014 Séan released his first post-GBS album. Produced by Joel Plaskett, “Help Your Self” is the sound of a man facing his demons and ultimately overcoming them. The songs helped him deal with his issues of addiction and abuse and showed him how to find strength in pain. It reminded him of the power of music which at one time would have been used to cast a Friday night spell over a sold out hockey arena on a Monday, but now finds him touring the country as a solo artist in intimate venues where he can sincerely connect with his audience in the way he always hoped to—face to face. Séan has also found himself using music as therapy, working with people who face physical, mental, and addiction challenges, and has become a sought after speaker trying to help others to help themselves find light through the darkness.<p>Séan’s journey to find his own peace, love, and happiness continues through his new music. “You Know I Love You” is a happy collection of songs sung by a man intent on sharing his joy directly with you. The world has changed. Today the only thing left between Séan’s music and those who wish to share it is a cellphone. Despite how small social media has made the world, and how it has included all of us into the same conversation with a simple hashtag #, the basic human quest for a connection to something real is too difficult to fit in just 140 characters. Luckily, through the years of technological advancement and subsequent social change, two universal energies remain constant— Music and Love.<p><strong>Presented by:</strong><p><strong><a href="http://markethall.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CMHA-HKPR-logo-with-tagline.jpg" rel="nofollow"></a></strong><p><a href="http://markethall.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mhlogo_branding.jpg" rel="nofollow"></a></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/san-mccann-/E0-001-095039875-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '48:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 82);

This will also be the focus for the ADBA National Conference 2016, held at One Great George Street in the heart of Westminster. The conference is an opportunity for the industry to meet and discuss the drivers for change with politicians, policy makers and business leaders.  And it’s your chance to find out how the UK’s changing relationship with the world and the priorities of a new government will affect your business. The AD industry is changing too. With almost 100 waste plants, and over 200 farm plants, the UK has a strong base – the conference is a chance for operators, developers and their suppliers to discuss changes to the RHI mechanisms, farming and waste policy and developments in the water sector. It’s also where you can hear about new research and innovation proposals which aim to put the UK at the heart of the global AD industry and expand the potential of the industry around the world. Despite constrained electricity incentives, the conference will look at where the next set of AD developments will come from. What will the government’s response to the RHI consultation mean in practice? Will a revised RTFO finally get HGVs and buses running on biomethane?  Can farming policy make up for the degressing Feed-in Tariff? Will food waste collections finally become the norm in England? What will the water companies be investing in, and will sludge market deregulation offer opportunities to the wider market? We look forward to seeing you there. adbioresources.org  ", "http://eventful.com/events/adba-national-conference-2016-/E0-001-096274704-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '01:30:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

Their debut single, “A World Without Love” –a song given to them by Paul McCartney – went to number one in over 30 countries, including the U.S. and U.K. In 1968, Mr. Asher became head of A&R for the Beatles newly formed record company, Apple Records, where he found, signed and produced James Taylor and worked closely with the Beatles on their individual projects.  During this period he became a key figure in the “revolution” of The Sixties, founding the book shop and art gallery “Indica” (where John and Yoko met and where Allen Ginsberg and William Boroughs visited) and found himself at the centre of an era of profound social and artistic change.<p>In 1971, Asher moved to the U.S. and founded Peter Asher Management, representing James Taylor and, beginning in 1973, the management and production of Linda Ronstadt as well.  Peter Asher Management became one of the most successful Artist Management companies in the US, handling artists such as Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman, and Carole King as well as James and Linda.<p>As a producer, Mr. Asher has worked with such diverse artists as James Taylor, 10,000 Maniacs, Diana Ross, Neil Diamond, Ringo Starr, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Morrissey, Robin Williams, Jane Monheit, Kenny Loggins, The Dixie Chicks, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Hans Zimmer and Billy Joel, among many others.  He has been awarded 37 RIAA-certified gold albums and 22 platinum albums in the U.S., and many more internationally.  Mr. Asher has produced thirteen Grammy Award-winning recordings, and in 1977 and 1989 was honored individually with the Grammy Award for “Producer of the Year”.  He won a further Grammy in the category of “Comedy Album of the Year” for his production work with Robin Williams.<p>After a 37 year gap, Peter & Gordon reunited in New York for one benefit concert for a friend on August 2, 2005 which was very successful and they went on to perform together on various special occasions just for the fun of it until Gordon’s untimely death in July of 2009.<p>Since then Peter has continued to be in high demand as a record producer, consultant, lecturer and as a performer again in his successful one-man show, “A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond”.   He has also received various international awards, is a member of Mensa and of SAG-AFTRA, a National Trustee of the Recording Academy and has been a frequent keynote speaker at industry events.<p>Other projects in recent years include “Carole King & James Taylor Live at the Troubadour”, an album from guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela (“Area 52”, recorded in Cuba) and the Buddy Holly tribute “Listen to Me” (an album and PBS TV Special<p>With Hans Zimmer, Peter produced music for “Pirates of the Caribbean 4”, “Sherlock Holmes 2”, “Madagascar 3”, “Man of Steel” and “Rush”.In fact, Peter sang and produced the only original song in “Madagascar 3”, the love theme “Love Always Comes as a Surprise” which Peter co-wrote with his friend Dave Stewart.

They are a study in contrasts; Cara, all earth mother on her 21-speed bike, helmet and backpack, environmentally friendly and wholesome, ebullient and engaging; and burly JD, looking like a cross between a biker and long-haul trucker in scruffy beard, ball cap, t-shirt and jean jacket, slightly intimidating (until you meet him). At first glance few would peg them for a highly creative musical partnership. Yet these two veteran singer/songwriters have teamed up and are building a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity and visceral performances. Luft is a <strong>Juno award winner</strong>, co-founder of folk trio <b>The Wailin’ Jennys</b>, and a touring road warrior. She has earned a solid reputation as an exciting live performer, accomplished guitarist, clawhammer banjo player and insightfully honest songwriter. Edwards has a voice that defies categorization, one that easily ranges from gentle and melodic to fierce and powerful, leaving listeners begging for more. He is truly one of the finest singers of his time.

A madman and an earnest poet. A strummer of delicate chords and a lover of bent and broken melodies. Ben Caplan is not any one thing. As he releases his second album, he&#39;s already gained a following in more than a dozen countries from Australia to Europe and across North America. It&#39;s no surprise. Caplan is simply unforgettable; with his huge beard and unruly mane, he is as visually striking as he is aurally compelling. His rough and textured tones cut through crowded halls; an enormous voice, roaring louder than raucous crowds. The microphone looks almost superfluous. But looks are deceiving; once he has your attention, Caplan can croon smoother than a glass of single malt whisky, pouring beauty into a harsh world. Inspired in part by Eastern European and Jewish folk traditions, Ben Caplan mixes older musical sensibilities with his own soul, straight from his hairy heart. Lyrically, you&#39;ve not heard the like before. Often edgy and dark, Caplan holds a mirror up to show us our nasty bits, singing about the ugliness and showing us that this darkness is the root of the sublime. His new album, Birds with Broken Wings, explodes with sounds both ancient and modern, with more than 30 musicians and even more instruments, combining acoustic sounds from around the world. It&#39;s all smoothly blended by the hottest international production team around. It&#39;s uncharted territory, and Caplan&#39;s leading the way.<p><br> </p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/ben-caplan-and-casual-smokers-/E0-001-096888782-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '02:30:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

This hall was built in 1883 as the Town Hall for East London and has a rich musical history. In 2009 he shifted the governance of the Aeolian into a registered chariy.  The Hall was  awarded “Best Live Venue in London” (Jack Richardson Music Awards)three times and “Top 10 Venues in Canada” (CBC radio 3).  In April 2011, Mr. Bryan was awarded a Jack Richardson Music Award in the “Contributor” category for his contributions to the musical landscape in the London Community.  In 2011, Mr. Bryan launched El Sistema at the Aeolian, a free UNESCO award winning music program for children and youth.  In January 2016, Mr. Bryan with the approval of his Board of Directors open a new education campus at Bishop Cronyn Memorial Place.  This new home for the El Sistema Aeolian program will also include many other educational programs soon to be implemented.  This new facility also includes a beautiful historic church facility for more artistic presentation.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/our-favourite-things-marion-miller-clark-bryan-/E0-001-096245232-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '02:30:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

They are a study in contrasts; Cara, all earth mother on her 21-speed bike, helmet and backpack, environmentally friendly and wholesome, ebullient and engaging; and burly JD, looking like a cross between a biker and long-haul trucker in scruffy beard, ball cap, t-shirt and jean jacket, slightly intimidating (until you meet him). At first glance few would peg them for a highly creative musical partnership. Yet these two veteran singer/songwriters have teamed up and are building a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity and visceral performances. Luft is a <strong>Juno award winner</strong>, co-founder of folk trio <b>The Wailin’ Jennys</b>, and a touring road warrior. She has earned a solid reputation as an exciting live performer, accomplished guitarist, clawhammer banjo player and insightfully honest songwriter. Edwards has a voice that defies categorization, one that easily ranges from gentle and melodic to fierce and powerful, leaving listeners begging for more. He is truly one of the finest singers of his time.

A madman and an earnest poet. A strummer of delicate chords and a lover of bent and broken melodies. Ben Caplan is not any one thing. As he releases his second album, he&#39;s already gained a following in more than a dozen countries from Australia to Europe and across North America. It&#39;s no surprise. Caplan is simply unforgettable; with his huge beard and unruly mane, he is as visually striking as he is aurally compelling. His rough and textured tones cut through crowded halls; an enormous voice, roaring louder than raucous crowds. The microphone looks almost superfluous. But looks are deceiving; once he has your attention, Caplan can croon smoother than a glass of single malt whisky, pouring beauty into a harsh world. Inspired in part by Eastern European and Jewish folk traditions, Ben Caplan mixes older musical sensibilities with his own soul, straight from his hairy heart. Lyrically, you&#39;ve not heard the like before. Often edgy and dark, Caplan holds a mirror up to show us our nasty bits, singing about the ugliness and showing us that this darkness is the root of the sublime. His new album, Birds with Broken Wings, explodes with sounds both ancient and modern, with more than 30 musicians and even more instruments, combining acoustic sounds from around the world. It&#39;s all smoothly blended by the hottest international production team around. It&#39;s uncharted territory, and Caplan&#39;s leading the way.<p><br> </p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/ben-caplan-and-casual-smokers-/E0-001-096888782-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '06:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

This hall was built in 1883 as the Town Hall for East London and has a rich musical history.

Drawing on the rich teachings of Buddhist masters and his life experiences in the east and west, Kushok will provide commentary and lead students in meditations designed to help you gain experience in how to develop an analytical approach to meditation.

Join us for this 7-week course to learn how to use the power of a focused mind to analyze habitual ingrained patterns of thought, philosophical points, and other aspects of the path. Analytical meditation is critical for enhancing the benefits of calm abiding meditation and vice versa. The two forms of meditation are complementary. Calm Abiding cultivates the ability to focus single-pointedly and Analytical meditation uses this clarity of mind to examine various states of mind and points of philosophy. Once the mind has gained certainty on the points being examined then the meditator switches back to Calm Abiding and rests the mind in that certainty. Through this alternation of the two practices one&#39;s meditation continually deepens.

The course runs 7:00-8:30 pm every Tuesday from Nov 1 to Dec 13 at Gaden Samten Ling’s Alberta Centre for Peace & Meditation located at 11403-101 Street in Edmonton. We invite you to stay afterward for tea, visiting with classmates, a browse of the bookstore, or a visit to our member’s library.

(1328, "to have & to hold – the physical book: more than a quaint tradition", " An Exhibition by Penny Parry Within the next few generations, how many physical experiences will be traded in for virtual ones?  More to the point, what might we as humans lose – how might we change in our basic nature, in such a headlong rush to embrace the virtual?  This mixed media installation will challenge this thought by offering aspects of the ‘physical book experience’ that sharpen and feed our senses. Penny Parry likes to play with ideas.  Her work is based in photography and narrative.  For many years, she has struggled with how to present her work and in doing so, has become more and more interested in the form and function of the book as a physical object.  In undertaking this exploration, the question of the impact of losing this particular experience evolved. Using Alice in Wonderland as inspiration, Parry uses photography, found objects and the creation of a 5 ft story book to invite the viewer to explore the value and joy of the physical book.

(1372, "10 Week Author Mentorship Program with Junie Swadron, Author & Writing Mentor", " DO YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK?  (blog, memoir, play, a series of short stories, stand-up comedy, fiction, creative non-fiction etc) Limited to 10 People (Advance Registration Recommended) Has anyone ever said to you… “I think you should write a book.” And you said, “Me? I don’t think so.”… Yet it sparks something in you that resonates deeply but you brush it aside. Or perhaps it has been a secret desire you have had for years but you don’t know how or where to begin. Maybe you are already in the midst of writing a book, blog, play or short story, but can’t seem to stay focused, so you stop.  Putting your voice out into the world in the form of a published work is a big deal. It’s a reflection of you—your imagination, thoughts, opinions, and often your tender heart!  If you are not used to being “out there” it can actually be terrifying.  Junie is an  author, playwright, and writing coach and for over 20 years she has also been working as a  psychotherapist. So along with her expertise in coaching writers to find their voice, become better writers and author books, she holds a sacred space for whatever emotional issues may arise throughout the writing and sharing process. What You Can Expect Weekly for 10 weeks, you will gather together with other writers to read and discuss what you have been working on for the past week—a chapter, an introduction, or something you are re-working. Even if you haven’t written anything that week, you will not be overlooked. I will work with you and discuss what may be holding you back and formulate strategies to move forward. A Holistic Experience: Students experience this program as above and beyond author support. Instead it is a sacred circle. It is an environment that at the same time you are being mentored in the craft of writing,  your heart is also held in the highest esteem.  Feedback: Everyone receives feedback from other group members and Junie. The feedback is always given with kindness and respect. It is specific, offering clarity about what’s working, what is not; what could use re-writing or tweaking—regarding characters, continuity, redundancy, length, believability etc. Are you speaking in the right voice for your audience, for your characters if it is fiction? Are you skimming the surface, needing to go deeper in order to get the reader fully involved—to make it compelling?  Do you use any of these reasons (excuses) to stop yourself from writing? It’s already been written There are already enough books on the subject I don’t want to hurt anyone Who am I to say this? I’m not an authority I’m afraid of peoples’ judgments I don’t know how to write I can’t spell I’m too old to start now; it’s too late It will take too long It’s too difficult You’re Not Alone! These common concerns will be dispelled right off the bat! Why be mentored by Junie Swadron? Junie has successfully coached thousands of writers, many of whom have become authors. In the process, they have also found their authentic voices which, in many cases, had been silenced for years. Things came full circle for her when  she wrote and published Re-Write Your Life and received a beautiful endorsement from her creative mentor, Julia Cameron, Author of The Artist’s Way “Junie Swadron is both a guide and a muse. Her book is a bright lantern, illuminating the often dark and tricky terrain of the soul. Grounded in personal experience, her techniques catalyze the deep authenticity possible to us all.” Here are 2 scenarios. Which one will YOU choose? 1st SCENARIO You want to write a book You don’t know how or where to begin You don’t think you are good enough There are things you know about and care about You are hesitant to say them out loud You are afraid of what people might think or say There are other reasons too You begin to shrink You stop Your dream ENDS here. 2nd SCENARIO You want to write a book You don’t know how or where to begin There are things you know and care about You are hesitant to say them out loud You are afraid of what people might think or say There are other reasons too Still, you say to yourself, “I am willing to feel the discomfort, put my fears aside and GO FOR IT.” Your dream BEGINS here. AND YOU WON&#39;T HAVE TO DO IT ALONE! It will be my joy and privilege to guide you right to the finish line. Love, Junie  “Your soul meets you on the page and something shifts. You strengthen. You begin to stand taller. And soon you begin to notice that your voice on the page has become your voice in the world.” Junie Swadron TESTIMONIALS  “Junie, it seems so simple and natural when you do it, but I don’t know anyone who hears and says back so clearly when I read my writing or speak my truth. You are the mirror who shines a light in the darkness just when I’ve convinced myself to give up, again. Thank you.”~Susan Beach “I had the opportunity to attend Junie Swadron’s Author Mentorship Program earlier this year. My manuscript, Julia’s Secret, had been stuck in a drawer for a couple of years at that time. I received amazing support and guidance from Junie and from the group. Junie is a wonderful facilitator—honest and heartfelt. The sessions were full of fun and extremely encouraging. Julia’s Secret is now finished and just waiting for the illustrations! My blog is out there too. The Author Mentorship Program was a brilliant kick starter. I recommend it 100%—with all my heart”    ~Anne Sture “When I began the group I was feeling stuck and uninspired. The weekly meetings provided the impetus to work on new material which created momentum (and progress). The support and feedback of the group was invaluable, making reflections available for writing still fresh on the page, applauding the successes and lovingly calling for more if the best was yet unwritten.”  ~Rob Mason “I participated in a writer’s support group with Junie and as I reflect back it still strikes me how much of a healing process it was. I thought I was joining a writing group which would give me some more writing tools to add to my belt, but I was pleasantly surprised, and I got much much more than that! This 8-week course was a catalyst for my leap of health that I find myself now. I can now stand lounging in this stronger place, enjoying the serenity that comes after releasing more of the layers of pain, after finding my way to healthier routines and habits. Junie’s programme helped me to see that indeed I have writing skills and gifts and it motivated me to pick up the pen and move on some projects that have been lying dormant for years. I am so grateful that Junie is honouring her gifts and sharing this with the world. The people that she attracts to the group are just as powerful, compassionate and inspiring as she is! Like attracts like. I feel honoured that I was in the same circle with such talented and creative people. Thanks Junie!     ~Kelly Terbasket “The Author Mentorship Program provided me with the encouragement and support to find my voice on paper and believe in it! Junie is a compassionate, skilled, intuitive and gentle facilitator… Amazing! Thank you!”    ~Pauline Karch “My Victoria Bench by Bench writings started before the book was even considered. Junie Swadron’s workshops nudged me back into a habit of writing. June’s special talent for facilitating writing groups pulled the words out of me. I started writing, not only for myself, but to share with others.”   ~Rebecca Kennel “The Author Mentorship Program has been a very nurturing environment to hatch my fledgling play and gradually take the steps to learn to fly. A great environment to meet others of like mind.“   ~Amy Robertson  “I loved being in the safe container of the Author Mentorship Program. The words of encouragement and wisdom from June and my sister writers were like powerful medicine, inspiring me to write and then write some more. I look forward to continuing and meeting more writers in the September group.”  ~Monica Kingsbury  “I am extremely privileged to have the opportunity of working with Junie as my writing coach as a prelude to the launch of a book or books in progress. I have personally experienced her magnificent facilitation and Junie’s gentle, yet powerful leadership skills propel all into a sacred space of acknowledgement, acceptance, safety and unleashed creativity. Junie’s processes guided by integrity, authenticity and absolute kindness create an atmosphere for raucous fun as well as ‘sacred reverence’. One of the most important gifts that I’ve received from Junie is learning to honour the sacred process of connecting with and expressing my own unique voice.”   ~Jeraldine Estin “As a writer working on my first book, I found June’s suggestions invaluable. Writing can be lonely work; her approach encouraged a strong bonding and mutual support among the group members. Especially helpful were tips on how to still the negative inner critic and how to break through writer’s block. I highly recommend The Author Mentorship Program.”  ~Ella Brown “Your love, friendship, advice and support encouraged me to finally birth this work of fiction, so long in gestation.”  ~Julia Joldersma LIMITED TO 10 PARTICIPANTS Advance Registration Recommended!

We will also explore how “space” was historically resolved on a flat surface and how the twentieth century contemporary artists were keen to negate this, imaginary volume and depth.

This course will motivate participants’ ability and talent while increasing their skill and knowledge. There will be plenty of time for discussions, class interactions, but also ample “hands on” painting periods.

It does not tolerate mistakes very well, and trying to recover from them is mostly useless. However, a fast evolving modern technology has also affected the paint industry, creating new materials and changing and altering the properties of existing ones. As a result the medium of watercolour has also changed, allowing it to be much more forgiving and versatile, opening up exciting new opportunities to play and experiment with it much more freely. This course is designed for those ready to “let watercolour loose”, painting outdoors in the Bluffs when weather allows and from own sketches and notes when in the studio. Learn hands-on how to turn “mistakes” into desirable effects, while taking the journey into the unknown watercolour territory.

The stories that came forth, the truths that were discovered and the connections that were made were astounding and remarkable. We were so excited by the conversations, ideas and movement forward that we witnessed that the logical next step was to offer this conversation, AND a solution to a larger audience of Women and Men.   So....

Their debut single, “A World Without Love” –a song given to them by Paul McCartney – went to number one in over 30 countries, including the U.S. and U.K. In 1968, Mr. Asher became head of A&R for the Beatles newly formed record company, Apple Records, where he found, signed and produced James Taylor and worked closely with the Beatles on their individual projects.  During this period he became a key figure in the “revolution” of The Sixties, founding the book shop and art gallery “Indica” (where John and Yoko met and where Allen Ginsberg and William Boroughs visited) and found himself at the centre of an era of profound social and artistic change.<p>In 1971, Asher moved to the U.S. and founded Peter Asher Management, representing James Taylor and, beginning in 1973, the management and production of Linda Ronstadt as well.  Peter Asher Management became one of the most successful Artist Management companies in the US, handling artists such as Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman, and Carole King as well as James and Linda.<p>As a producer, Mr. Asher has worked with such diverse artists as James Taylor, 10,000 Maniacs, Diana Ross, Neil Diamond, Ringo Starr, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Morrissey, Robin Williams, Jane Monheit, Kenny Loggins, The Dixie Chicks, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Hans Zimmer and Billy Joel, among many others.  He has been awarded 37 RIAA-certified gold albums and 22 platinum albums in the U.S., and many more internationally.  Mr. Asher has produced thirteen Grammy Award-winning recordings, and in 1977 and 1989 was honored individually with the Grammy Award for “Producer of the Year”.  He won a further Grammy in the category of “Comedy Album of the Year” for his production work with Robin Williams.<p>After a 37 year gap, Peter & Gordon reunited in New York for one benefit concert for a friend on August 2, 2005 which was very successful and they went on to perform together on various special occasions just for the fun of it until Gordon’s untimely death in July of 2009.<p>Since then Peter has continued to be in high demand as a record producer, consultant, lecturer and as a performer again in his successful one-man show, “A Musical Memoir of the 60s and Beyond”.   He has also received various international awards, is a member of Mensa and of SAG-AFTRA, a National Trustee of the Recording Academy and has been a frequent keynote speaker at industry events.<p>Other projects in recent years include “Carole King & James Taylor Live at the Troubadour”, an album from guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela (“Area 52”, recorded in Cuba) and the Buddy Holly tribute “Listen to Me” (an album and PBS TV Special<p>With Hans Zimmer, Peter produced music for “Pirates of the Caribbean 4”, “Sherlock Holmes 2”, “Madagascar 3”, “Man of Steel” and “Rush”.In fact, Peter sang and produced the only original song in “Madagascar 3”, the love theme “Love Always Comes as a Surprise” which Peter co-wrote with his friend Dave Stewart.

They are a study in contrasts; Cara, all earth mother on her 21-speed bike, helmet and backpack, environmentally friendly and wholesome, ebullient and engaging; and burly JD, looking like a cross between a biker and long-haul trucker in scruffy beard, ball cap, t-shirt and jean jacket, slightly intimidating (until you meet him). At first glance few would peg them for a highly creative musical partnership. Yet these two veteran singer/songwriters have teamed up and are building a buzz around their tight harmonies, authenticity and visceral performances. Luft is a <strong>Juno award winner</strong>, co-founder of folk trio <b>The Wailin’ Jennys</b>, and a touring road warrior. She has earned a solid reputation as an exciting live performer, accomplished guitarist, clawhammer banjo player and insightfully honest songwriter. Edwards has a voice that defies categorization, one that easily ranges from gentle and melodic to fierce and powerful, leaving listeners begging for more. He is truly one of the finest singers of his time. Together as <b>The Small Glories</b>, Luft and Edwards are a tour de force, a case of 1 + 1 = 3.<p> <p>Photo by Mike Latschislaw<p> <br></p></p></p></p>", "http://toronto.eventful.com/events/small-glories-cara-luft-jd-edwards-/E0-001-097037381-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '06:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, NULL);

A madman and an earnest poet. A strummer of delicate chords and a lover of bent and broken melodies. Ben Caplan is not any one thing. As he releases his second album, he&#39;s already gained a following in more than a dozen countries from Australia to Europe and across North America. It&#39;s no surprise. Caplan is simply unforgettable; with his huge beard and unruly mane, he is as visually striking as he is aurally compelling. His rough and textured tones cut through crowded halls; an enormous voice, roaring louder than raucous crowds. The microphone looks almost superfluous. But looks are deceiving; once he has your attention, Caplan can croon smoother than a glass of single malt whisky, pouring beauty into a harsh world. Inspired in part by Eastern European and Jewish folk traditions, Ben Caplan mixes older musical sensibilities with his own soul, straight from his hairy heart. Lyrically, you&#39;ve not heard the like before. Often edgy and dark, Caplan holds a mirror up to show us our nasty bits, singing about the ugliness and showing us that this darkness is the root of the sublime. His new album, Birds with Broken Wings, explodes with sounds both ancient and modern, with more than 30 musicians and even more instruments, combining acoustic sounds from around the world. It&#39;s all smoothly blended by the hottest international production team around. It&#39;s uncharted territory, and Caplan&#39;s leading the way.<p><br> </p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/ben-caplan-and-casual-smokers-/E0-001-096888782-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '06:00:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);

She maintains a consistently full studio of piano students ranging in age and level, enjoying teaching and making the main priority always expression insisting that one learn to express rather than just impress.<p>She and Clark Bryan have enjoyed playing together over many years on the same keyboard and as a piano duo. As Clark said  in one interview &quot;we fit like a glove&quot;.<p>In his youth<strong> CLARK BRYAN</strong> trained with longtime pupil of the renowned pianist Géza Anda, Antonia Mazanova.

He has done performances for CBC radio and television including a broadcast recital in 2002 at the Glenn Gould Studio, CBC. He has adjudicated music festivals from St. John’s to Vancouver.  Mr. Bryan has done extensive music editing including the New Millennium Piano Series for Conservatory Canada.  A recent project of note is a book entitled:  “Gateways to Learning and Memory” published in 2009.<p>Mr. Bryan has recorded eleven albums of solo piano and a duo piano album of the Suites for two pianos by Serge Rachmaninoff with duo partner Marion Miller.  His most recent recordings include the complete Chopin Nocturnes.<p>In 2004, Mr. Bryan purchased the Aeolian Performing Arts Centre and School of Music, a magnificent acoustic marvel in London, Ontario. This hall was built in 1883 as the Town Hall for East London and has a rich musical history. In 2009 he shifted the governance of the Aeolian into a registered chariy.  The Hall was  awarded “Best Live Venue in London” (Jack Richardson Music Awards)three times and “Top 10 Venues in Canada” (CBC radio 3).  In April 2011, Mr. Bryan was awarded a Jack Richardson Music Award in the “Contributor” category for his contributions to the musical landscape in the London Community.  In 2011, Mr. Bryan launched El Sistema at the Aeolian, a free UNESCO award winning music program for children and youth.  In January 2016, Mr. Bryan with the approval of his Board of Directors open a new education campus at Bishop Cronyn Memorial Place.  This new home for the El Sistema Aeolian program will also include many other educational programs soon to be implemented.  This new facility also includes a beautiful historic church facility for more artistic presentation.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "http://eventful.com/events/our-favourite-things-marion-miller-clark-bryan-/E0-001-096245232-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "INTERVAL '02:30:00' HOUR TO MINUTE", NULL, 122);
